            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Otherwiſe, this is a <hi>Title</hi> I durſt not have ventured upon, in <hi>Down-right-honeſt-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> with reference to <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> in regard there have been ſome <hi>Mutations</hi> in <hi>thoſe</hi> Parts ſince this <hi>Verſion</hi> of mine; and 'tis impoſſible to give a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> or ſo much as an <hi>Indirect</hi> Account of the <hi>preſent Circumſtances,</hi> under which all <hi>thoſe</hi> parts of the World <hi>now</hi> lie: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the <hi>Conſideration</hi> of 'em is <hi>Brief,</hi> tho' interlined with many Curious and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Obſervations,</hi> which make up about <hi>half</hi> the Book.

            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, our <hi>Author</hi> is not wholly to be <hi>Condemn'd</hi> for his <hi>wide Title,</hi> ſince,
<pb facs="tcp:153186:9"/>in <hi>ſome meaſure,</hi> he may lay <hi>Claim</hi> to have given very <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Preſent Notices</hi> of the <hi>fartheſt</hi> Parts of the Earth; where he ſhews the <hi>ſettlements</hi> the <hi>Europeans</hi> have made in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſages, Tracts</hi> and <hi>Courſes</hi> they <hi>now</hi> take, or of <hi>old</hi> took in <hi>Navigation,</hi> with <hi>other particulars,</hi> of the like <hi>ſtamp,</hi> peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to our Times.</p>
            <p>And here, <hi>one thing</hi> I muſt not be ſilent in, that ſince our Author was very <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>Careleſs</hi> in the Deſcription of <hi>our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi> and <hi>Plantations</hi> abroad (and who could expect any <hi>other</hi> from him; I have <hi>preſumed,</hi> and, I hope, <hi>innocently</hi> enough, to <hi>add ſeveral</hi> things, to him, in ſeveral places, and would have added <hi>many</hi> more, had not the <hi>Sheets</hi> been committed to the Preſs without my <hi>re-touching</hi> them, and the greater part of them Printed off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my <hi>Privity:</hi> And this <hi>true Excuſe</hi> I have for the <hi>ſparing</hi> and <hi>ſtingy</hi> Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>France,</hi> and for the want of our <hi>own Routs</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and other Places, which I had deſign'd to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd and added.

            <p>You must not expect here any <hi>Praecognita</hi> to this <hi>Geography,</hi> nor the treating of <hi>that</hi> part of it, which is called <hi>Spherical,</hi> it being no part of his <hi>Deſign,</hi> and the World being <hi>cloy'd</hi> with Books enough of ſuch a Concern already.

               <p>There are two Principal Villages, <hi>Hola</hi> and <hi>Schalholt:</hi> As for Cities, it has none; the Houſes in other places are commonly of Wood; cover'd with the Bark of Trees and with Turfs.

               <p>THe <hi>Antartick Land</hi> is often called <hi>Auſtralis Magellanica Incognita.</hi> We might with juſt title name them the <hi>Southern Indies,</hi> and the third World. Thoſe who would engage Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes, to promote the diſcovery of theſe Lands, ſay, that they are of as great an extent as all <hi>America,</hi> nor leſs Peopled, or leſs Fertile, than <hi>Europe:</hi> They may have above Six thouſand Miles of Coaſt in three ſeveral Zones of the Southern part of the World, the Hot, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and Cold: Perhaps Countreys might there be found of all manner of temperament, tho' none have yet been beyond the 68 Degree of <hi>Southern</hi> Latitude. Amongſt the Streights that are there, that of <hi>Magellan,</hi> firſt afforded a way in the year 1523. to voyage it round the World through the South Sea: this Streight is Two hundred Leagues in length: in breadth, in ſome places, two, three, in others, five, ſix, or ten. Thoſe who paſs through it, receive great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, by reaſon of the ſinuoſities and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the frequent ſtorms that are there. The Streights of <hi>Maire,</hi> which were diſcovered in the year 1615. are much more commodious; 'tis but ten or twelve Leagues in length, and as many in breadth. That of <hi>Brouvers,</hi> which was paſs'd in the year 1643. is on the South-Eaſt, and has the ſame advantages with that of <hi>Le Maire.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſometimes ſteer this Courſe to go to the <hi>East Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, under the name of <hi>Antartick</hi> Lands, are reckoned Countries which indeed are very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153186:15"/>far diſtant from the Southern Pole, but which cannot be attributed to the other great parts of the World, ſince they are ſeparated from it by Seas of a vaſt extent; <hi>New Guiney, the Iſles of Solomon, New Zealand, the Land of Fire, the Land of Parrots, New Holland.</hi> There's hardly any thing known of the other Southern Parts befides the Names of thoſe who diſcovered them.</p>

                  <hi>New Guiney,</hi> towards the <hi>South</hi> of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxial Line, and in the Inferiour Hemiſphere, is a very great Iſle, and bears this Name, becauſe it ſeems to be Diametrically oppoſite to the <hi>Guiney</hi> of <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iſles of <hi>Solomon</hi> are in the South Sea, at ten or twelve Degrees of the Southern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

In all probability it was diſcovered by <hi>Fernandez de Quir,</hi> who tells a thouſand advantageous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it; He ſpent Fourteen Years in his Travels, Fourteen Months at Court, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, in vain, Eight Petitions, to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to perſuade him to ſend Colonies thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>The Land of <hi>Parrots</hi> is probably that which we call <hi>Terra Auſtralis.</hi> In the year 1504. a <hi>French</hi>-man, called <hi>Gonneville,</hi> went on ſhoar there, and was kindly receiv'd by a petty King, called <hi>Aroſca:</hi> After ſeveral Months abode, he brought away with him ſome of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and amongſt others, one called <hi>Eſſomeriq,</hi> a King's Son, who has left of his Poſterity in <hi>Normandy.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153186:16"/>of trading thither, had given it very ſtrange Names, calling it <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> and the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands:</hi> and that for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Name of <hi>Tarſis,</hi> they had called by the ſame Name ſeveral Places of our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, where the Merchants had their Banks and their Correſpondencies. Several are perſuaded, that the City and Iſland of <hi>Cadiz</hi> are now what was formerly <hi>Tarſis.</hi> Thoſe Soveraigns pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there were Dragons, Infernal Rivers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Cherubim with a flaming Sword; which were probably nothing elſe than thoſe ſtorms which are frequent in the Torrid Zone, and the Inſults of Corſairs and Pyrates, who watcht the the coming of the Gallies and Fleet from <hi>Terra firma,</hi> to get Booty. Several do aſſure us, that it was to the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Iſle, <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> went, when he conducted towards the South Weſt, a Fleet of Sixty Sail, with Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Men. They alſo ſay, That five years afterwards, the ſame <hi>Hanno,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into his own Countrey, prohibited all ſuch Voyages to his Citizens, that their City might not be depopulated, by their going to dwell there, charmed with the great Riches that were to be found in thoſe-Countries, for fear the Rebels might make it an <hi>Aſile,</hi> to the ruin of their State. Thoſe Authors find but little credit, who undertake to prove by a feigned Medal of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was pretended to be found in thoſe parts, or by a ſuppoſed Marble, taken out of the ground in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> with <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes of a forged <hi>Sybile,</hi> touching the diſcovery of this New World. If it be then true, that <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> was known by the Ancients, we may ſay,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153186:17"/>that the perils People muſt expoſe themſelves to in traverſing the Seas that are between the two great Continents before they arrive there, and the little experience the Ancients had in Navigation, did make 'em abandon the perſuit of their Commerce into theſe Regions; and that had it not been for the favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that was made by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to <hi>Columbus,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal had been rejected by the Government of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould perhaps be ſtill to learn, if there was any other Continent than ours.</p>

This makes us ſee, that the moſt or the leaſt heat is not always cauſed by the proximity or remoteneſs of the Sun, and that which contributes thereto often is the ſituation of Places, the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mountains and Valleys, the quality of the Soil, and the diverſity of the Winds which blow in thoſe reſpective Regions.</p>
               <p>The Riches of <hi>America</hi> are ſo great, that <hi>Spain</hi> has drawn out from thence, and does ſtill draw every year a prodigious quantity of Gold and Silver, of which many private perſons of <hi>Europe,</hi> both in Peace and War, under diverſe borrowed Names, receive a good ſhare.

                  <hi>America</hi> is not peopled comparatively with the parts of our Continent; perhaps by reaſon of the continual Wars which the Inhabitants wage there againſt one another, or elſe becauſe of the cruel treatments the <hi>Indians</hi> have received from the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> ſome Authors do atteſt, they have put to Death there ſeveral Millions of Perſons, whether for Religion, or for other Pretexts; and that the Blood of thoſe who have periſhed in the, Mines where they have been forc'd to labour, would weigh more than the Gold and Silver they have thence extracted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> met with no ſtrong reſiſtance in their Conqueſts, where they found none to make head againſt 'em, but naked People, whoſe Armies were eaſily broken by the Noiſe only of a Canon-ſhot, or at the ſight of a Horſe-man. The poor <hi>Indians</hi> ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were the Maſters of Thunder; they thought 'em half Men and half Horſes, or ſome Sea-Monſters, when they ſaw 'em on Horſe-back; And when they ſaw them on board their Ships, eating Bisket, and drinking Claret, they ſaid they were deſcended from Heaven upon a great Bird; that they eat Stones, and drank Blood.</p>
               <p>If we confider the ſituation of the Iſlands of that part of the World, we ſhall find that <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia</hi> is in the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Northern America;</hi> the <hi>New Lands,</hi> the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> and the <hi>Antilles,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>East.</hi>

               <p>The Mountains of the <hi>Andes</hi> Croſs all <hi>Southern America</hi> from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>South.</hi> That of <hi>Potoſi</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> is eſteem'd the richeſt of all, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153186:19"/>reaſon of its Silver Mines. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would perſuade us, that there are others in the Neighbourhood at leaſt as rich.</p>
               <p>The <hi>North</hi> Sea is ſo call'd, becauſe it is on the <hi>North</hi> of the firm Land, which makes part of the <hi>Southern America,</hi> and was ſooner diſcovered than the <hi>Northern America;</hi> in regard of which it cannot bear the Name of the <hi>North Sea.</hi> 'Tis called the <hi>Green Sea</hi> towards the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> by reaſon of the Herbs found there upon the Surface of the Waters. The <hi>South</hi> Sea is really <hi>Southern,</hi> in regard of that <hi>North</hi> Sea; but if we conſider all <hi>America,</hi> both <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern,</hi> we ſhall find that it is <hi>Weſtern.</hi> It's often called <hi>Pacific,</hi> by reaſon of its pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Calms, or elſe becauſe very few Acts of Hoſtility are perform'd there. Between <hi>Mexico</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>California,</hi> 'tis call'd the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million</hi> Sea: It hardly receives any conſiderable Rivers. The Sweet Sea, which is in <hi>Canada,</hi> and the <hi>Parime</hi> Sea, in <hi>Southern America,</hi> bear the names of Lakes, becauſe they are in the midſt of Lands. Many are of opinion, that by this <hi>Sweet</hi> Sea, the <hi>Northorn</hi> Sea communicates with with the <hi>Southern.</hi>

               <p>Among the Rivers of <hi>America,</hi> that of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> or St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> is vulgarly call'd the Great River, perhaps for that it receives above two thouſand others, great and ſmall, and that above five hundred Leagues above <hi>Quebeck;</hi> its ſource has not yet been found out: It makes ſome Lakes grow narrow; ſometimes it caſts it ſelf among the Rocks with ſuch impetuoſity, that 'tis impoſſible to paſs there, by reaſon of the number of Water-falls, which they call <hi>Saults,</hi> and Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe thoſe who mean to go over, muſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153186:20"/>carry their little Boats upon their ſhoulders, which they term Canoes. Its ordinary breadth is full twelve or thirteen Leagues; its depth does often exceed two hundred fathom: it keeps its Waters clear as far as below <hi>Quebeck.</hi> The River of <hi>Chayre,</hi> upon the Confines of the two <hi>America's,</hi> affords means for the Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Merchandizes from one Sea to the other. <hi>L'Orenoyu</hi> is the largeſt of all thoſe of <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>Amanzon</hi> is eſteemed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſtrongeſt, and deepeſt of all thoſe of theſe Countreys, and one of the fierceſt in the World. In the Year 1638. the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who were then under the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> remounted it up as far as <hi>Quito</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and came down again the following Year. It has its Inundations as well as the <hi>Nile,</hi> whereby the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is not incommoded with Inſects: Above a hundred and fifty ſeveral Nations have been obſerv'd to dwell in the Neighbourhood of this great River, and thoſe which fall into it. <hi>La Plata</hi> has its Name from the Mines of Silver which are near it. Towards its beginning it bears the Name of <hi>Paraguay,</hi> after having joyned that of <hi>Parana;</hi> it rowls its Waters for above ſixty Leagues, without any mixture: 'tis not deep, tho' towards its mouth it is ſixty or eighty Leagues broad, and ten for the moſt part of its Courſe, where after having form'd ſeveral Iſlands, and the greateſt Cataract in the World, it keeps its ſwiftneſs for above forty Leagues diſtance in the Sea. It might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much towards the carrying on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce from one Sea to the other; but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> do not think fit to put this <hi>Adviſo</hi> in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for fear other Nations might thereby
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153186:20"/>become acquainted with it, who would make better advantage than they do of ſuch Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>

It has all the Commodities of <hi>Europe,</hi> unleſs Wine and Oyl. Formerly 'twas an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Kingdom, full of great Cities, governed with great Policy, and its Inhabitants very civil. Its Kings could bring into the Field, Armies of three or four hundred thouſand tall fighting Men. The Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who have a Vice-Roy there, whoſe Reſidence is in the Caſtle of <hi>Mexico,</hi> have taken care to erect ſeveral Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> are well made, dexterous in melting their Metals, and in making Pictures of their Feathers, which they have off their <hi>Cincons,</hi> ſmall Birds of their Countrey, which live only upon Dew. They keep their Balls in the open Field, where it is pleaſant to ſee 'em Dance, or rather, make Gamboles, and perform the Double Sommerſet, ſometimes two or three thouſand together.</p>
                  <p>Formerly the <hi>Mexicans</hi> divided their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys into hot and cold. At preſent the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> reckon their ſeveral ſmall Provinces; as <hi>New Galicia, Guadalaira, New Biſcay, Mexico, Mechoachan, Panuco, Jucatan, Guatimala, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duras, Nicaregua, Coſtarica, Veragua,</hi> and others. They have eſtabliſh'd Royal Audiences, I mean Parliaments, at <hi>Mexico, Guadalaira,</hi> and <hi>Guatimala.</hi> There is a ſort of Ravenous Birds in <hi>Guadalaira,</hi> which are not much greater than our Sparrows, and nevertheleſs make a horrible diſtruction of their Corn: they have Bees too without ſtings. The Province of <hi>Mexico,</hi> properly taken, is that which lies near the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the greateſt, richeſt and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153186:26"/>beſt peopled of all <hi>America.</hi> This City ſuffer'd a great loſs in the Year 1629. all its <hi>Digues,</hi> and moſt of its Houſes, having been carried away by the violence of the Waters, its ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being neer a Salt-water-Lake, of about twenty five or thirty Leagues in circuit, where there enters another Lake of ſweet Water. Since that, it has been rebuilt, and has full a hundred thouſand Houſes, great and ſmall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, there were ſeveral places very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable neer <hi>Mexico. Chulula</hi> contain'd above twenty thouſand Houſes, with as many Temples as there are days in the year; and its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants did annually put to death five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their Children, in ſacrificing them to their Idols. <hi>Tezeuco</hi> was twice as big as <hi>Seville</hi> in <hi>Spain. Queretaro</hi> had a Fountain which wou'd furniſh Water for four years together, and ceaſe running four years after. <hi>Los Angelos,</hi> upon the way from <hi>Vera Cruz</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> is a City of ten thouſand Inhabitants, where is a Biſhoprick of great Revenue; there's alſo a Mint for the coining of Money: Cloth, Hats and excellent Glaſſes, are made there too. <hi>Acapulco</hi> upon the South Sea, with a Fort of five Baſtions, is a Bay of good ſecurity, tho' at the entrance it be but a League in breadth. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum</hi> is a <hi>Peninſula</hi> between the two Gulphs, where the City of <hi>Merida</hi> is ſo call'd, upon the account of its ancient Structures and Buildings, which were found equal to thoſe of <hi>Merida</hi> in <hi>Europe. Tabaſco,</hi> the firſt City that made any defence againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is a Province, where the Inhabitants have great Priviledges, becauſe they contributed much to the Conqueſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153186:26"/>of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Near <hi>Tabaſco, Cortez</hi> gain'd a great Victory in the Year 1518. over <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma,</hi> the Ninth and laſt King of <hi>Mexico;</hi> We killed there upon the ſpot above three hundred thouſand <hi>Indians.</hi> This Land is ſo fertile, that a Peaſant having cauſed two Sheep to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Caſtile,</hi> thoſe two Sheep multiplied in ſuch a manner that there were above forty thouſand of 'em in a few years: The Iſle of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zumel,</hi> near the Coaſt, is famous upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its ancient Idol. <hi>Guatimala</hi> produces Balm, Sulphur, Wood, and Cacao, which is a Fruit like to little Almonds, whereof the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants make a very delicious Drink. Near <hi>Guatimala,</hi> is a <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that is, a Mountain which caſts forth Fire; where a private perſon ſeeking after Treaſures, which he fancied there, found the End both of his Wealth and his Life. The <hi>Henduras</hi> furniſhes Honey, Cotten, Cloaths, and Wool. <hi>Niceregua</hi> was firſt of all named the Paradice of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by reaſon of its fertility, and the quantity of its Gold. Its Lake of a hundred and thirty Leagues in length, ebbs and flows and diſgorges it ſelf into the North Sea. There was once a deſign of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it with the South Sea, but they imagin'd this would cauſe a great deal of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this Sea being much higher than the North Sea, becauſe of ſeveral Rivers, which have their ſource in its Neighbourhood, and nevertheleſs fall into the North Sea. One of the laſt Kings of <hi>Niceregua,</hi> ſeems to have had ſome knowledge of the Myſteries of our Faith; He ask'd the <hi>Spaniards, What they knew of the Deluge? If any was to happen? If the Sun and Moon won'd one day loſe their light? What was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153186:27"/>the Cauſe of their Motion? Whither the Souls went after the ſeparation from their Bodies? If the</hi> Pope <hi>and</hi> Emperour <hi>were immortal? And for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſought after Gold and Silver with ſo much Eagerneſs and ſo many Perils?</hi>

Another of thoſe <hi>C aciques</hi> being Condemned to be burnt, was ſollicited by a Prieſt to turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that he might go into Paradice, but he openly proteſted he would not go thither, ſince <hi>Spaniards</hi> were there too.

                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Guayana</hi> are long liv'd, by reaſon of the good Air they breath. The Eaſt Winds are regular there; and it is never exceſſively hot or cruelly cold.

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:153186:34"/>in the Year 1525. the Civil Wars which followed, did for ſome time retard the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Conqueſt.

It is certain, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought from thence to the value of above twenty Millions of <hi>Ducats,</hi> in the firſt Voyage they made thither. The ſecurity of the Ways is ſo great, that Commodities often to the worth of three or four hundred thouſand <hi>Ducats</hi> are frequently conducted under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy only of four Muſqueteers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Incas</hi> had reign'd hereditarily in <hi>Peru</hi> for above three hundred years, before the coming of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They had cauſed there to be made two Royal High-ways, the one in the Plain, where they were at great Charges in ſetling the Sand; and the other in the Mountains, where it was neceſſary to fill up ſeveral Valleys. Theſe Ways were each of 'em five hundred Leagues in length, and there were Houſes where Travellers were entertain'd by the Inhabitants, with all the care and civility imaginable. The ſame <hi>Incas</hi> had alſo cauſed Temples to be built to the Sun, to the Moon, and the Stars, which they called the <hi>Moons Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlewomen,</hi> to Lightning, to Thunder, and the Rain-bow, which they ſaid was the Executioner of the Kings Juſtice. Some ſay, that their <hi>Policy</hi> reſembled in ſome manner that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> that their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153186:34"/>was full of Eaſe, Franchiſes, and Liberality. They divided the World into three parts, High, Low, and Subterranean, ſignifying thereby, Heaven, Earth, and Hell. <hi>Atabalippa,</hi> one of the laſt of thoſe <hi>Incas,</hi> ſaid, The <hi>Pope</hi> was not wiſe, to give away what belonged not to him; and that he the ſaid <hi>Atabalippa,</hi> had right to prefer the Divinity of the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of a Crucified Man: He likewiſe threw down upon the ground a Breviary that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, becauſe it ſpoke not a word, and they had made him hope it would tell him fine things. This unhappy Prince having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Camamalca,</hi> offered as much Gold as a Room ſeven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot in length could hold, ſeventeen in breadth, and proportionably high, to the half of its height: Notwithſtanding which, he was put to death, as a Conſpiratour and a Tyrant. It is not to be wondred at the abundance of the <hi>Incas</hi> Gold and Silver, ſince they had in Gold all the Animals and Plants they had the knowledge of, and had Temples, where they plac'd a number of Statues of pure Gold, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite company of Precious Stones: thoſe rich Fabricks have been demoliſh'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in hopes of finding Gold in the Materials and joyning of the ſtones, which were cemented with it, tho' they were of a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The Provinces of <hi>Peru,</hi> are <hi>Quito, los Reyes, los Charcas, la Sierra.

Callao,</hi> a Sea-port Town, two Leagues from <hi>Lima,</hi> is capable of receiving and ſecuring ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ships. <hi>Cuſco,</hi> built four hundred years before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took it, is very Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe the Kings kept commonly their Court there, and oblig'd the <hi>Caciques,</hi> or Lords of the Countrey, to build each a Houſe there, and make it the place of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Reſidence.

The King of <hi>Spain</hi> drew thence formerly every year above a Million of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts for his Fifth; but ſince, they are much diminiſhed.

The difficulty of paſſing through theſe Mountains, obliges the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> when they go thither, to take their way by Sea: They have had it in poſſeſſion ſince the year 1554. Some parts of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are ſo fruitful and pleaſant, chiefly to'wards the Sea-Coaſts, that there are none of all <hi>America</hi> that better reſemble thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> which we eſteem the fineſt.

                  <p>Tho' <hi>Braſile</hi> be under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> its Air is temperate, its Waters the beſt in the World; Its Inhabitants live often a hundred and fifty years and more.

There are ſuch Animals, Trees, Fruits, and Roots, as are not ſeen in other parts. The Serpents Adders, Water-Snakes and Toads, have no Venome, and ſerve for Food for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The Fields are deſtined to Sugars, the Mountains for Woods, and the Valleys for Tobacco, for Fruits and for <hi>Mandioche,</hi> which is a kind of Root, which the Inhabitants make their Bread of.

                  <p>The Coaſt of <hi>Braſile</hi> is divided into four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Praefectures,</hi> or <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> which are called <hi>Capitania's,</hi> and belong at preſent all to the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> In the Year 1654, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> loſt all they had Conquered in theſe parts, the War they had then with <hi>England</hi> not ſuffering them to ſend ſuccours thither, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Colonies were there much better eſtabliſhed than theirs.

                  <p>As concerning the inward part of <hi>Braſile,</hi> it is not much known; but what is known, take as followeth; The Inhabitants there go naked for the moſt part, and have the dexterity of paſſing great Rivers by the help of a Panyer, and a Rope. Three Letters of our Alphabet, are of no uſe amongſt them, F, L, R; Some ſay, its becauſe they have neither Faith, nor Law, nor Ruler.

               <p>The greateſt Rivers of <hi>Africa,</hi> are the <hi>Nile</hi> and the <hi>Niger.</hi> The <hi>Nile</hi> according to the neweſt Relations, has its Sourſe in <hi>Abyſſinia,</hi> at twelve Degrees of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude; and runs a Courſe of full five hundred Leagues, after having paſs'd thro' the Lake <hi>Bar-Dambea.</hi> Its <hi>Cataracts,</hi> or Water-falls, are towards its Source, and in the Confines of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> its Mouths make their influx into the <hi>Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the <hi>Ancients</hi> have left ſeven, and the <hi>Neotericks</hi> four: Tho', indeed, there are but two of them now, unleſs there's an Inundation.

The cauſe of it has been diverſly alledged; ſome have ſaid this River communicates its ſelf with the Ocean, by the Lake and River of <hi>Zaire:</hi> and that the ſtorms of the Sea cauſe its Waters to ſwell: Others affirm, that the ſand, which gathers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Mouths, ſtops them, and that the Northerly Winds drove them up. Several Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns believe that theſe Waters encreaſe from the thawed Snow, and from the Rains, which fall regularly, and abundantly in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> It has lately been found out, that the <hi>Nitre,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Nile</hi> abounds ſo much, is the cauſe of all theſe wonderful effects, and that being heated by the Sun, it mingles it ſelf with the Water, renders it troubled, ſwells it, and makes it paſs over its Banks, inſomuch that the Mud, which the <hi>Nile</hi> conveyes, does not come from elſewhere, nor does it make its Banks the higher.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Niger</hi> keeps its ancient Name, which it received from the people whoſe Countrey it Waters; It ſometimes goes under the Earth, and before it empties it ſelf into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, it forms three principal Branches, the <hi>Senega, Gambia,</hi> and <hi>Rio Grande.</hi> It fertilizes all the places it paſſes through, and an abundance of Grains of Gold are found in its Sand.

Ptolomey</hi> intended a Memorable Work,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153186:43"/>in making <hi>Africa</hi> an Iſland; <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s deſign was to make her Ships paſs into the Red Sea, that ſhe might have eſcap'd falling into <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>'s hands.

               <p>The <hi>Africans</hi> exact great Services from their Elephants, their Camels, and their huge Apes; Dromedaries they call a ſort of Camels, ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and ſwifter than the others: they have wild Aſſes, Unicorns, Barbes, Cameleons, Marmou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and Parrots.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153186:44"/>populous, by reaſon of the conveniency of trade. Some Sea-men call <hi>Barbary,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> from the Streight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> as far as <hi>Cap-Blanc,</hi> which is at twenty Degrees of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude. The <hi>Romans, Sarazens, Vandals, Arabians, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who have been conſecutively the Lords of the <hi>Barbary</hi> we treat of, have given very different Names to its Towns. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperour ſways over the greateſt portion of it. The Kings of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> poſſeſs what is moſt towards the <hi>West.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards, Portugueſe,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> have Towns upon the Coaſt, which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhall be enumerated. <hi>Suſaon, Couco, Labes,</hi> are little States, which maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Mountains. <hi>Salley, Tituan, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> are Towns belonging to <hi>Corſairs;</hi> the three laſt under the Protection of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who ſends <hi>Baſhaws</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they have not much authority.

                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were the firſt that made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Africa,</hi> and had it not been for the deſign they entertain'd of carrying their Arms into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> from which they expected more advantage, they would undoubtedly have made Progreſſes there much more conſiderable, by reaſon of the Diviſions which were at that time in the Kingdoms of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco.</hi>

Amongſt ſome of their Cuſtoms 'tis obſerv'd, they are at exceſſive charges in their Nuptials, as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are in their Law-Suits, and the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Paſſeovers. They cauſe themſelves to be buryed in thoſe places, where no Body was enterred before, that when they riſe again, they may not be puzzled to know and diſtinguiſh their Members from thoſe of others. They were uſed to crucifie their Criminals, but ſince they took notice, that the Chriſtians have a reſpect for Croſſes, and that a great Drought once happened during ſome Executions, which nevertheleſs was followed with ſome Rains, after that the Croſſes were taken away; they attributed this bleſſing to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and order'd that, for the future, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſhould either be Hang'd or Beheaded.

                     <hi>Amaſis,</hi> one of its ancient Kings, it had full twenty thouſand Cities. The plenty of Corn it affords, made the Ancients call it the Publick Granary of the World. The abundance or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, depended on the good or ill Harveſt in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The <hi>Nile,</hi> by the inundation of its Waters, which are full of Nitre, (as we ſaid before) gives it this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; not by wholly covering the Lands, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have imagin'd, but being brought into ſeveral Channels, after the Inhabitants have broke the Dikes. That part which is on the Eaſt of the <hi>Nile,</hi> is more fruitful than that which is on the Eaſt of the River.

                     <hi>NIgritia</hi> is ſo called from its ancient People, the <hi>Nigritae,</hi> who reciprocally ſeem to have had their Name from their black Colour, or from that of their Land, which in ſome places is all burnt by the exceſſive heat, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153186:53"/>contributes to the blackning both the Sand and the Inhabitants. They who attribute this blackneſs to the Race of <hi>Cham,</hi> ſay, that people of other Countreys preſerve their whiteneſs in <hi>Nigritia,</hi> and that the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> and the <hi>Americans,</hi> who are in the ſame Zone with the <hi>Negroes,</hi> are not naturally black. The <hi>Niger</hi> does ſomewhat temper the Country, by means of its Waters, but the Rains which fall there, occaſion ſeveral Diſeaſes. As Commerce is now in high conſideration amongſt the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Nations, it is not improper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Coaſt of <hi>Nigritia. Cap Blanc</hi> is a tongue of Land as hard as a Rock, ten or twelve fathom high, with a very ſpacious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Ships are ſafe againſt moſt Winds. <hi>Arguin,</hi> a Caſtle in a little Iſland, belongs to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The Barks may enter into the River of St. <hi>John,</hi> and treat with the <hi>Negroes</hi> for Oſtridge-Feathers, Gums, Amber, and ſome ſmall Gold. <hi>Senega,</hi> one of the principal Branches of the <hi>Niger,</hi> is not a League in breadth, at its diſemboguing it ſelf into the Sea. The Coaſt on the North of <hi>Senega</hi> is very low, and hardly to be kenn'd by thoſe that are twelve Leagues diſtant at Sea. The Road of <hi>Cape-Verd,</hi> has twelve or thirteen fathom water, upon a bottom of grey Sand. The Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> called <hi>Gorea,</hi> has a Plat-form, flank'd by four Baſtions of Earth, with a Dungeon of Bricks, which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being inſulted in the late Wars. The entrance into it is on the Weſt of the Iſland, where Ships of a hundred Tun may touch and ride. The Road is good, but no freſh water to be had. <hi>Rufiſca</hi> is a retreat
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153186:54"/>commodious enough. <hi>Gambia</hi> is about five Leagues broad at its influx into the Sea, but it is not Navigable for Barks above ſixty Leagues. 'Tis ſaid, that the <hi>Portugals</hi> have remounted the <hi>Niger</hi> ſometimes as far as the Kingdom of <hi>Benin,</hi> in the ſpace of above eighteen hundred Leagues; that the <hi>Danes</hi> have formerly poſſeſs'd <hi>Cantozi,</hi> towards the place where the <hi>Niger</hi> divides it ſelf; and that this <hi>Niger</hi> forms great Lakes, upon the Banks of which there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good Cities, from whence go Caravans as far as <hi>Tripoli</hi> of <hi>Barbary.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in hopes of getting ſome of the Gold of the Countrey, had a deſign to go up the <hi>Senega</hi> with ſeveral light Ships; but the exceſſive heats, the inſults of the <hi>Negroes</hi> accompanied with ſome <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> made them lay aſide the thoughts of their Enterprize. The <hi>Negroes</hi> are commonly ſimple and candid, Idolaters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, <hi>Mahometans</hi> in the inland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. They have three pretty conſiderable Kingdoms, <hi>Tombut, Borno,</hi> and <hi>Gaoga.</hi> Moſt of their Cities are not to be compared with our Towns, the Houſes being only built of Wood, Chalk, and Straw; and often one of theſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties makes a Kingdom. The laſt Kings of <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but,</hi> whom they call <hi>Tombouctou,</hi> have had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of poſſeſſing a great quantity of Gold in Bars and Ingots. They are ſaid to have this Gold from the Kingdom of <hi>Gago;</hi> and that from the Kingdoms of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Sus,</hi> there go often ſeveral <hi>Cafiles,</hi> or <hi>Caravans,</hi> for the bringing it thence. The Kingdom of <hi>Gualata</hi> produces <hi>Milet.</hi> That of <hi>Agades</hi> has a City indifferently well built. <hi>Borno,</hi> formerly the abode of the <hi>Garamantes,</hi> is inhabited by a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153186:54"/>People who live in common; private perſons there, acknowledge for their Children, thoſe who reſemble them, and the flatteſt noſed are the handſomeſt and greateſt Beauties. Several Nations are between the branches of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> where ſome Authors place the Gardens of the <hi>Heſperides.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Senega</hi> ſend abroad Slaves, Gold in duſt, Hides, Gums and Civit Cats.

They are ſo-ſo Souldiers for <hi>Africans;</hi> but they have not the Art of Building, nor of Grinding their Corn; and they often eat Cows fleſh all raw, with Salt and Pepper, which they look upon as a peculiar Delicacy. They have Civet-Cats, and make uſe of Cloth, Stones, Salt; and little pieces of Iron, inſtead of money; for which purpoſe, they alſo uſe Gold, which they give by weight.

'Tis full of Mountains, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to great Colds, and under ſeveral petty Kings, who for the moſt part pay tribute to the Emperour of <hi>Mono-Motapa.</hi> The King of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fala</hi> pays it to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who has a Garriſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Sofala,</hi> and who, by the means of this Garriſon, draws abundance of Gold from the Mines, which are in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Countrey. This Gold is accounted as good as any in the World; they gather it likewiſe in the Rivers, with Nets, after there has been Rain. <hi>Solomon</hi> might poſſibly have had his come from hence, which he employed in the building of the Temple. The Coaſt of <hi>Cafreria</hi> is low, and full of Woods: the Soyl produces Flowers of an grateful ſmell, and the Trees make a curious proſpect. Three great Rivers diſcharge 'emſelves into the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas, through <hi>Cafre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> all three known in the beginning, under the name of <hi>Zambera, Cuama, Spirito Santo, les In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Cafres</hi> live without Law, ſo as their Name ſpeaks them. They often furniſh the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who come thither, with their Cattel: But the Mariners now cauſe the Oxen they buy to betied to great Poſts, and ſhut up the Sheep
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153186:59"/>before they pay 'em, becauſe the <hi>Cafres,</hi> after having ſold 'em, were uſed to make 'em return home with the Call of a Whiſtle, which is wholly peculiar to 'em. We may ſay of 'em, in ſeeing their colour, that they reſemble our Chimney-ſweepers; Beſides, that they have big Heads, flat Noſes; whether they take care to break them in their infancy; or that this happens, becauſe when they are little, their Mothers carry them continually upon the Back: Be it how it will, they look upon it as one of the Beauties of the Countrey, to have them in that manner. They have frizl'd Hair, Lips extraordinary big, the Chine of the Back ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſharp, and very large Hips, inſomuch, that nothing can be ſeen more terrible: So that we are not to wonder if <hi>Pirard</hi> calls 'em, <hi>thoſe Devils of</hi> Cafres.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> which lies toward the moſt Southern part of this Countrey, is by much the longeſt; the moſt famous and the moſt dangerous Cape in the World. 'Twas called ſo, in hopes of arriving ſuddenly at the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> when it was veered in the year 1498. Before, it had the Name of the <hi>Tempeſtuous Cape,</hi> from the ſtorms that are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereabouts. Some have call'd it the <hi>Lyon of the Sea,</hi> others the <hi>Head of Africa:</hi> There are Signs by which the Sailers know when they are near it; fifty or ſixty Leagues off they find the Bodies of great Reeds, called <hi>Trombes,</hi> floating on the Sea; and they ſee fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of white Birds, mark'd with black ſpots. They who return from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> ſee Troops of <hi>Sea Wolves,</hi> made like Bears, and then they are continually ſounding. This

                     <hi>Cape</hi> ſerves for bounds to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi>-Companies: As they go to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and return from thence, they muſt of neceſſity come in ken of it. The Land enjovs a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Air; ſeveral Valleys have Herbs and Flowers in abundance. There are Rivers full of Fiſh, and Woods full of Deer and Cattel. The Inhabitants, who make their Garments of Beaſts-skins, are very good at running, but very villanous in their Diet, and when they ſpeak, you'd think you heard Turkey-Cocks.</p>

The Common People only wear Garments below their middle. A Relation, that was publiſh'd in the year 1631, tells us, That the King then reigning, was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, with all his Court, by the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> This Prince is commonly adorn'd with Chains and Jewels, like a Bride: He is ſaid to have, for his uſual Guard, a Regiment of Women, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Doggs; and that in the Armies thoſe Women do not leſs ſervice than the Men. The Princes, who pay him Tribute, receive every Year firing from him, for a Mark of the Fealty they owe him; the City, which is the moſt conſiderable, has the ſame Name with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153186:60"/>Kingdom; <hi>Zimbaoe</hi> is a ſquare Fortreſs, and the abode of the Court. <hi>Mono-Emugi</hi> is a State on the North of <hi>Mono-Motapa.</hi> The <hi>Giaques,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Galles</hi> and <hi>Chava,</hi> border upon it, and are illuſtrious for their Valour, and for their Conqueſts which they have made, in our time, over <hi>Abiſſinia,</hi> in the upper <hi>Aethiopia.</hi>

There is ſo great abundance of it, principally in the Iſle of <hi>May,</hi> that the <hi>Flemmings</hi> call all theſe Iſlands, the Iſles of Salt. The chief one is that of St. <hi>James,</hi> with a ſmall Town of the ſame Name; the others are St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> St. <hi>Lucy</hi>'s, St. <hi>Nicholas, Inſula Salis, Buen avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, del Fogo,</hi> and <hi>de Brave;</hi> there are ſome of theſe who have no Inhabitants, unleſs ſome Goatherds. The Ocean, which is near it, bears the Name of the Green Sea, by reaſon of the great abundance of an Herb, that is found there of a Green and Yellowiſh Colour, which makes it reſemble a Meadow, in the double <hi>Latin</hi> ſenſe of <hi>Aequor.</hi>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153186:69"/>under extream ſubjection. The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion is received in moſt places.

                  <p>This <hi>Turkey</hi> is certainly in a choice ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the midſt of our Continent, and in the Temperate Zone; it has the Courſe of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and <hi>Tigris,</hi> with the conveniency of four Seas, the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> and that of <hi>El-Catif,</hi> which open to it the Commerce of the principal Regions of the World, and particularly, that of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> The <hi>Euphrates</hi> having paſs'd near the ruins of the ancient <hi>Babylon,</hi> joins it ſelf to the <hi>Tigris</hi> below <hi>Bagdad.</hi> Its Channel is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in thoſe parts by reaſon of the many Iſlets that are made there. It has this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that it joins the Traffick of the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> which is not far diſtant from its Sources, with that of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> The <hi>Tigris</hi> forms ſeveral Lakes, ſometimes going under the Earth, and after having paſſed by <hi>Bagdad,</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Euphrates.</hi> The Waters of theſe two Rivers, fall into the Sea <hi>El-Catif;</hi> formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> now under that of <hi>Tigris,</hi> or rather under that of <hi>Chat,</hi> which is called the <hi>Arabick</hi> River.

                  <p>Four great Provinces are in this <hi>Turkey Natolia, Turcomania, Dierbech,</hi> and <hi>Souria.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153186:70"/>for <hi>Homer</hi>'s immortal Banter, has its ruins mingled with the decays of ſome Modern works.

Chalcedon</hi> is the place, where was held the Fourth General Council. As its ancient Inhabitants were cracking, that their City was built before <hi>Bizantium;</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> told them judiciouſly, that its Founders had been blind, to chooſe ſo incommodious a ſcituation, in reſpect of that of <hi>Bizantium.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153186:71"/>greateſt Commerces in the <hi>Mediteranean-Sea:</hi> The <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> have their reſpective Conſuls there. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did in vain endeavour to ditch the <hi>Peninſula</hi> that is near it; this is ſaid to be the only Enterprize which that <hi>Heroe</hi> was unable to bring about. <hi>Epheſus</hi> has had the Temple of <hi>Diana. Melazo,</hi> formerly <hi>Miletum,</hi> has eſtabliſh'd ſeveral Colonies in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places, and held out a long while againſt the Kings of <hi>Lydia.</hi> It was near ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Iſlands of the City of <hi>Miletum,</hi> that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was taken by Pyrates. <hi>Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> boaſts of having had the <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> built by Queen <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> in memory of King <hi>Mauſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> her Husband. <hi>Santhe</hi> prides it ſelf in the brave reſiſtance of its ancient Citizens, who ſuffered all the Extremities imaginable, in the ſieges they held out, at ſeveral times, againſt <hi>Harpagus, Alexander</hi> the Great, and againſt <hi>Brutus. Sattalia,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Antali,</hi> gives its Name to a neighbouring Gulph. <hi>Tarſus</hi> was the place of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Education. <hi>Tiagna</hi> is the native Countrey of the learned <hi>Apollonius; Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> that of <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Strabo. Zela,</hi> which is not far off, is renowned for the Victory of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> over <hi>Pharnaces. Trebizond</hi> has been the capital City of an Empire of ſhort continuance: This Empire having been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by <hi>Iſaac Comnone,</hi> who having retir'd from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, Emperour of the <hi>Turks;</hi> the ſame who rendred himſelf Maſter of the Empire of the <hi>Greeks. Laiazza</hi> is near the paſſage of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> where ſeveral Battels have been fought. The modern Hiſtory ſets down that of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> againſt <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Second,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153186:71"/>Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> wherein the latter was defeated: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, gained here a memorable Victory, over <hi>Darius,</hi> in perſon. <hi>Ventidius Baſſus,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> vanquiſhed the <hi>Parthians</hi> here; and the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited <hi>Peſcenninus Niger,</hi> his Rival to the Empire. Near this Place we are ſhown the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City of <hi>Anchialus,</hi> which is ſaid to have been built in a day by <hi>Sardanapalus:</hi> Perhaps the Workmen of that Age were as dexterous as the modern <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who in the Market ſell Houſes whole, and ready made to be ſet up. Amongſt the Rivers of <hi>Aſia Minor, Thermodoon,</hi> now <hi>Pormon,</hi> has had the <hi>Amazons</hi> in its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. <hi>Lalli</hi> ſerv'd for bounds to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>Cirus</hi> and <hi>Croeſus; Granique</hi> towards the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> has been witneſs of the firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great over the <hi>Perſians; Pactolus,</hi> near <hi>Sardis,</hi> has been famous for its golden Sand, which gave occaſion to the great Riches of the Kings of <hi>Lydia:</hi> the <hi>Meander</hi> for its fine Swans, and its Sinuoſities. The <hi>Cidne,</hi> near <hi>Tarſus,</hi> has its Waters ſo cold, that they killed the Emperour <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> who bathed himſelf therein: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, having done the like, was abandoned by moſt of his Phyſicians, and was only cured by the Remedy of <hi>Philip,</hi> who ordered a Potion pretty like the modern <hi>Emetic</hi> Wine. The moſt renowned Mountains of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> are <hi>Taurus, Ida,</hi> and <hi>Micale. Taurus</hi> divides all <hi>Aſia</hi> into two parts, as we have already ſaid. It is the moſt famous in the World for its length, for its heighth, and its branches, <hi>Caucaſus</hi> and <hi>Imaus</hi> are parts of it. <hi>Ida,</hi> near <hi>Troy,</hi> is famous for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris; Micale,</hi> near <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153186:72"/>Sea Engagement, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> won over the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the ſame day that theſe were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd at <hi>Platees</hi> in <hi>Boeotia.</hi>

This conſideration has made moſt of the Merchants of <hi>Turkey,</hi> go under the name of <hi>Armenians.</hi> There are ſtill at this day, in <hi>Armonia, Curdes,</hi> who defend their Liberty. The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> has alſo ſome part of it. He is in poſſeſſion of <hi>Erevan,</hi> which has in its neighbourhood the three Churches, the abode of the Patriarch of the <hi>Armenians.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> draw from thence a conſiderable Tribute, for the paſſage of the <hi>Caravans:</hi> For the better ſubjecting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what they ſtand poſſeſs'd of, they have carried thence whole Colonies, who inhabit the City of <hi>Giulfa,</hi> near <hi>Iſpaham.

Two Cities now ruin'd, have been very conſiderable there, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh,</hi> and <hi>Babilon. Niniveh,</hi> oppoſite to and on the Eaſt of <hi>Moſul</hi> and beyond the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> was the abode of the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> with twenty four of our Leagues in compaſs: The voluntary Death of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of its Inhabitants, have made it the labour of Hiſtory. <hi>Babilon,</hi> a ſmall days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Bagdad,</hi> which is upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> has nothing more than ruins in a place called <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lougia.</hi> In the neighbourhood is ſhown the place where was the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> famous for the confuſion of Tongues. This <hi>Babilon</hi> was built by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who is ſaid to be the ſame with <hi>Belus;</hi> Queen <hi>Semiramis,</hi> as alſo <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> did much augment it: This Princeſs having cauſed Walls to be raiſed there, which have made it paſs for one of the Seven Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153186:73"/>of the World, and its fine Gardens in Terrace have given admiration to ſeveral perſons. As it hath been the object of the greateſt Conquerours of the Eaſt, it has been taken by <hi>Cirus,</hi> by <hi>Darius,</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who died there at his return from his Conqueſts, and by <hi>Seleucus.</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were there in captivity, for the ſpace of ſeventy years: the Countrey round about produces two ſorts of Pitch, the one dry, which is made uſe of in Buildings, the other liquid and very ſuceptible of fire, having this particular, of not being to be extinguiſh'd, but with Dirt, Vinegar, Alom, and Glew. The Power and Riches of <hi>Babilon</hi> have been ſo great, that it alone contributed more to King <hi>Cirus,</hi> than did the third part of his Dominions. After <hi>Babilon, Seleucia</hi> has been conſiderable in <hi>Aſſiria, Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Vologe-ſocerta,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>Bagdad,</hi> which is in the place of <hi>Cteſiphon. Bagdad,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Baldac,</hi> and which is vulgarly called <hi>Babilon,</hi> is not only reſorted to by Merchants of ſeveral Nations, but alſo by <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who go thither from all parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to viſit, in its neighbourhood, the Sepulchres of <hi>Omar, Ali,</hi> and other Diſciples of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> It was for a long while the Reſidence of the <hi>Caliphs:</hi> one of whom, named <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lit,</hi> has had the glory of being Maſter of the greateſt Monarchy that has ever been in the World: It extended from the moſt Weſtern parts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> to the <hi>Indus.</hi> 'Tis obſerv'd of another <hi>Caliph,</hi> of this ſame City, that he left, at his death, eight Sons, eight Daughters, eight Millions of Gold, eight thouſand Slaves, and his Dominions aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by eight Kingdoms. In the Year 1638,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153186:73"/>when the Grand Seignior, <hi>Amurath</hi> the Fourth recover'd this ſtrong and important City of <hi>Bagdad</hi> from the <hi>Perſians;</hi> he caus'd three Men of each Company of his Army to be caſt into the Ditch, and upon them a number of Faggots, and Sacks of Wool, for the making the Aſſault with the more facility. <hi>Kufa</hi> is a Town, which the Inhabitants have in peculiar veneration, by reaſon of the Sepulcher of <hi>Ali.</hi> They keep there a Horſe always ready to mount him, whom they ſay is to come and convert the whole World to their Law. <hi>Baſſora</hi> is a Town near the mouth of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> called <hi>Chat</hi> by thoſe of the Countrey. 'Tis ſpacious and pleaſant, by reaſon of its Palm-Trees. By the means of its Harbour, it furniſhes the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> with Dates, which ſerve for Bread and Wine, to thoſe who know how to prepare them. Its great Commerce of Horſes, makes it often called by the Name of <hi>Mer-El-Catif.</hi> They were uſed to Voyage, upon this Sea or Gulph, along the ſhoar, and with the lead in hand. The Barks that are made uſe of there, are ſewed with little Cords of <hi>Coco;</hi> inſomuch, that not any Nails are to be perceived in 'em. Some few years ago, <hi>Baſſora</hi> belong'd to <hi>Ali</hi> Baſhaw, who called himſelf King of it, and who had this ſtate from Father to Son, and was the <hi>Dominus fac-totum,</hi> paying only a ſmall tribute to the Grand Seignior, who did not preſs him, for fear he ſhould take the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſide.</p>

It is really the third of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, if we conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort thither of the <hi>Caravans,</hi> the Rendezvouz of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armies in the Wars of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and all its other advantages. The Jewels, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Silks, and other precious Commodities, arrive here from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> by Sea, and by Land: They ſend them afterwards into <hi>Barbary,</hi> by means of the Port of <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. They there make uſe of <hi>Camels,</hi> for the going to <hi>Bir,</hi> where they might have the conveniency of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> as far as the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bagdad;</hi> but ſeveral Mills there hinder the Navigation. It's fine to ſee upon that River, the Peaſants going down the ſtream upon <hi>Goats</hi>-skins, which they fill with Wind, and let out again, when they have made uſe of them. <hi>Antioch</hi> which, for excellency, has the Denomination of <hi>Great,</hi> was the abode of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, and the Cradle of Chriſtianity, St. <hi>Paul</hi> having eſtabliſhed here the firſt <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of the Church. It has had formerly a Suburb called <hi>Daphne,</hi> which paſſed for one of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious places in the World. <hi>Damas,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> ſends us ſweet ſmelling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Wines, pleaſurable Fruits, Prunes, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, Cutlaſſes, Sword Blades; and other works, which keep the Name of it.

In its Neighbourhood, is to be ſeen the Caſtle of <hi>Tygade,</hi> the ancient obode of Old <hi>de la Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Aſſaſſins,</hi> who executed blindly all the Orders of their Sovereign. Saint <hi>John de Aere,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Ptolemaida,</hi> formerly the Reſidence of the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> is accompanied with a Sea-Haven. <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> is remarkable for its height, for its fertility, for the ancient Cedars, which have been found there, ſince the Creation of the World. It has full ſixty Leagues in compaſs, and forty Villages of the <hi>Maronites.</hi> Thoſe people who are <hi>Catholicks,</hi> receive their Name from the Monaſtery of <hi>Saint-Maron:</hi> They are in poſſeſſion of four hundred Villages, and can bring fifteen thouſand Men in Arms. <hi>Canobin</hi> is the Reſidence of their Patriarch, who bears the Title of that of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Beſides the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronites</hi> in this <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> are <hi>Emirs,</hi> or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Nations of the <hi>Druſes, Naſſarians, Kelbins,</hi> who maintain there their liberty. The Holy Land, where the principal Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Salvation were wrought; is (as it were) in the midſt of our Continent. It was firſt of all named the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the Land of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Land of <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Judea, Paleſtine;</hi> and finally the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> by reaſon of the Birth, and Death of the Saviour of the World, and in conſideration of the abode of the Prophets. Its principal and firſt Diviſions
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153186:75"/>have been into eleven people, who bore the Names of the Children of <hi>Canaan;</hi> into fifty two Kingdoms, and five <hi>Satrapies:</hi> into twelve Tribes, who went under the Names of the Children of <hi>Jacob.</hi> 'Tis however to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> are the Names of the Children of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who died before the Diviſion; and that the Tribes, who had the Lands on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of <hi>Jordan,</hi> had them upon condition of engaging firſt in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Actions. The other Diviſions of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land,</hi> have been into twelve Governments under <hi>Solomon:</hi> Into two Kingdoms, <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> Into ſix Provinces, after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Into three <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces: Into five Tribunals or Audiences, by <hi>Gabinius:</hi> And laſtly, Into three Eccleſiaſtical Provinces. The <hi>Holy-Land</hi> has hardly, at preſent, any place of Remark; and the <hi>Turks</hi> only preſerve the Towns they have there, by reaſon of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which they exact from the Pilgrims. It had formerly Cities ſo rich, ſo powerful, and in ſuch great numbers, that no Countrey in the World was there that could be compared to't, for that reaſon: there having been reckoned above five hundred and ſeventy. Its extent from the South to the North, is about ſeventy Leagues; Its breadth thirty, ſomewhere more, ſomewhere leſs, according as it is bounded, either by the Mountains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or by <hi>Jordan.</hi> What is there call'd the Deſart, is ſo ſtiled, in that it has not all the fertility, that is found in the Countreys which are near it. Its modern Diviſion is into three Principalities, <hi>Sayd, Coſſaria,</hi> and <hi>Gaza.</hi> Two Governments are under the Baſhaw of <hi>Damaſcus, Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:153186:75"/>and <hi>Naplouſe. Jeruſalem,</hi> tho' fallen from its ancient Luſtre, ſtill preſerves thoſe places, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was pleas'd to honour with his preſence. It has been famous for the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beauty, and riches of its Temple; for its Kings; for its High-Prieſts; and for other particularities. It was ruined by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> Theſe two laſt ſaw the Death of Eleven hundred thouſand Perſons. There are eight Nations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are rank'd in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> the <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Jacobites,</hi> the <hi>Copties,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Georgians.</hi> One of the Gates of the City, called <hi>the Eye of a Needle,</hi> has given occaſion to the <hi>Proverb,</hi> that <hi>a Camel</hi> may as ſoon paſs through the Eye of a Needle, as a Rich man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the place, where the Saviour of the World was conceived; <hi>Bethlem</hi> that where he was born. There are an infinite number of rare things to be remark'd upon theſe Cities of the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> The misfortune is, that they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any longer to be known.</p>

This <hi>Famaguſta</hi> was the laſt place, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> defended there againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who took it at laſt after a Siege of ſeventy dayes, and above a hundred and forty thouſand Shot made againſt the Town. The <hi>Grotto</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Sleepers,</hi> is near
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153186:76"/>the City of <hi>Baffo.</hi> In an Abbey near <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> they keep Cats, brought up to the hunting of Serpents, after which they return back thither at the ringing of a Bell. The Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> is famous for the ancient abode of the Knights of the ſame Name, who were conſtrained to yield it to the <hi>Turk</hi> in the Year 1522: For the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which was ſo prodigious, that few perſons could embrace the thumb of it: Great Ships paſſed eaſily with full Sails be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its Leggs: When the <hi>Sarazens</hi> cauſed the Copper of it to be carried into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they found it to load above nine hundred Camels. The Iſles of <hi>Chio,</hi> and <hi>Metilin,</hi> are in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago. Chio</hi> one of the moſt fertile and moſt delicious in the World, produces excellent Fruits, Malmſy Wine, and particularly <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</hi> It has the High and Low Town, and in both are reckoned above twenty thouſand Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: They are almoſt all <hi>Chriſtians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> and there is not a place under the <hi>Turk,</hi> where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have more freedom. <hi>Metelin</hi> affords excellent Wines: And the Nightingales are ſaid to ſing more melodiouſly there, than elſewhere. Its ancient Inhabitants have had the reputation of being very expert Mariners. In the laſt Age, the famous <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa,</hi> who is ſaid to have been a Native of this Iſland, rendred himſelf formidable to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. <hi>Patmos,</hi> or <hi>Palmoſa,</hi> is known for the Exile, and the Grotto of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. The Iſle of <hi>Lango,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Cos,</hi> has paſſed for the native Countrey of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Appelles.</hi> The enviers of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> attribute all his knowledge to Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Receipts, which were brought into the

The Inhabitants of <hi>Lango,</hi> are ſaid to have found out the firſt uſe of Silk-Worms. Not far from thence, there is a little Iſland called <hi>Caloiero,</hi> which is almoſt impregnable: It is only a ſteep Rock, where the Monks, and thoſe who inhabit it, draw up their Boats after them with Ropes.</p>

                     <hi>Arabia</hi> in general, is ſubject to ſuch great heats, that they are conſtrain'd to keep the Markets by night. There is a great number of Mountains, and few Rivers. It is divided into three parts, <hi>Petraea, Deſerta,</hi> and <hi>Foelix:</hi> the two former is almoſt wholly in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks; Arabia Foelix</hi> has ſeveral petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</p>

                     <hi>Arabia Petraea</hi> was inhabited by the <hi>Madia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Moabites, Amalekites,</hi> and <hi>Idumeans;</hi> Nations of whom mention is often made in the Holy Oracles. Its Inhabitants pay Tribute to the Baſhaw of <hi>Cairo.

Tor,</hi> upon the Red-Sea, is a Port defended by a four-ſquare Caſtle. There are in the places adjacent found petrified
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153186:81"/>Muſhrooms, white Corral, <hi>Chagrin,</hi> ſmall Oyſters, and ſometimes <hi>Sea-men,</hi> or ſuch people as are bred and live in the Sea. 'Tis ſaid, the Red-Sea is but three Leagues broad in that place, and that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſs'd it over there dry-ſhod, when they came out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> that it was one of the Ports, from whence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſent his Fleets into <hi>Ophir,</hi> to fetch Gold. Pegs of Wood are put into the Ships of the Places, that belong to this Sea, becauſe little Iron is to be found there. Thoſe, who have a mind to impoſe, Talk as that, if they made uſe of Iron Nails, inſtead of Pegs, the Ships would be attacked and ſtopp'd by the Loadſtone, that is found in the neighbouring Mountains. Mount <hi>Oreb</hi> is famous in the Holy Writ, for the burning Buſh wherein God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to <hi>Moſes.

                     <hi>Arabia Deſerta</hi> is a Countrey, where they often want good Water; tho' there be ſome Wells, the Water, for the moſt part, is hardly worth any thing. <hi>Ana,</hi> upon the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> has an <hi>Arabian Emir.</hi> There is a King in this <hi>Arabia,</hi> who has a moving and portative City, which conſiſts in Tents, and he cauſes it to be carried whither he pleaſeth. He takes this courſe, to avoid being ſurpriz'd by the <hi>Turks. Sumiſcaſac</hi> is eſteem'd the ancient <hi>Saba,</hi> from whence departed the three Kings, (or rather wiſe Men) to come and adore the Saviour of the World in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>

                     <hi>Arabia Faelix</hi> goes under that Name, as being a good Countrey. It has Horſes very much eſteem'd, Manna, Cinnamon, Myrrh, Balm, Benjamin, Incenſe, and other Perfumes. There is ſo great a quantity of Incenſe, that from the Port of <hi>Dolfar,</hi> the Inhabitants furniſh the principal parts of the World. <hi>Aden</hi> is a City of great trade, in a ſmall <hi>Peninſula,</hi> at the foot of a Mountain, with two Caſtles towards the North, and a ſmall Fortreſs at the entrance of the Harbour. The <hi>Portugals,</hi> at the time of their eſtabliſhment in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Aden, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and <hi>Malaca,</hi> by reaſon of their important ſituations. The <hi>Turks</hi> prevented them at <hi>Aden,</hi> whoſe King they cauſed to be hang'd on the Maſt of their Captain's Galley. Since that time, there have been ſome Revolutions, thoſe of the Countrey having diſpoſſeſs'd the <hi>Turks.

Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been uſed to make his Tomb paſs for a Wonder, as if it was ſuſpended in the Air, by the means of the Load-ſtone; this is not only found to be a fallacy, but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhews us ſuch like things: <hi>Democritus,</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> by order of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> undertook to make the Statue of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinoe</hi> all of Iron, for to diſpoſe it after the like manner; and in the Temple of <hi>Serapis</hi> in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> they formerly hung up, the ſame way, a Sun made of a very delicate Iron. The Prince of <hi>Mecha,</hi> called <hi>Sultan Scherif,</hi> is one of the moſt Potent of all <hi>Arabia:</hi> His moſt uſual Reſidence is in <hi>Almacharana:</hi> The <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> makes him often Preſents, and cauſes part of the Revenue of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to be given him, by reaſon that he's of the Race of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and to oblige him to defend the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pilgrims. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Scherifs,</hi> the Relations of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> call them <hi>Emirs. Fartach, Caxem, Gubel-haman, Alibinali, Amanzirifdin, Masfa, Maſcalat; Jemen,</hi> are as many Sultanies, or ſmall Kingdoms in <hi>Arabia-Felix. Maſcate</hi> formerly belonging to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> has for a long while carried on the trade from the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the <hi>Mecha,</hi> by the means of the Cities <hi>El-Catif</hi>

                     <hi>PErſia</hi> bears the Name of one of its ancient Provinces, that is now called <hi>Fars.</hi> It's one of the moſt conſiderable Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia,</hi> by reaſon of the Riches of its principal Towns, and the Union of its Forces; it is more fertil and populous than <hi>Turkey;</hi> its Inhabitants the moſt civil, and the beſt poliſhed of all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans.</hi> There is more politickneſs, and more refined Wits than in <hi>Turkey.</hi> They love good order, and juſtice, and favour Strangers. Its Rivers, which have this particular of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:153186:83"/>neither Pike nor Eel, are not Navigable: They commonly go under the Name either of their Cities, or their Colours: They furniſh the conveniency for the making of Channels, for the watering the Lands; they become ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the nearer they come to the Sea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are entirely dryed up by the Diverſions, that are made of them. The Neighbourhood of the Sea of <hi>Baſſera,</hi> and that of the <hi>Caspian,</hi> is more fertil, and more temperate, than the Inland Countreys which have Deſarts, and Mountains, where it ſeldom rains, for which cauſe the Fruit-trees receive no Water but at the Foot, and Root. This Kingdom is one of the moſt Ancient Monarchies of the World; the <hi>Aſſyrians, Medes, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> have begun their Empires here. The Policy of this Kingdom is in great eſteem, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eaſie, ſupportable to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and to Strangers. There is no talk of Robbers; the Rights of Hoſpitality are ſo regularly obſerv'd, that the King will have all Foreigners to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as his Gueſts. The Name of <hi>Scha,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on the Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> the Vulgar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them that of <hi>Sophi;</hi> which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name. They were formerly call'd Great Kings, and Kings of kings; principally when they had Vanquiſhed the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The Name of <hi>Sultan,</hi> which in <hi>Turkey</hi> ſignifies King; in <hi>Perſia,</hi> only ſignifies the Governour of a Town. The <hi>Perſians</hi> have alwayes had their Sovereign in great eſtimation: Still at this day they think to confirm a thing much more ſtrongly by the name of their King, than by that of God; perhaps after the Mode of thoſe of <hi>Achem</hi> in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153186:83"/>Iſle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> who ſay, that God is afar off, and the King near at hand. The Riches of the ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings have been immenſe, as may be ſeen by the Treaſures, which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great found in the Coffers of <hi>Darius. Scha-Sefi,</hi> one of the late Monarchs, had for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſervice 7200 Marks in Veſſels of Gold. <hi>Herbert</hi> ſays, that in his time, there has been ſeen in <hi>Aſharat,</hi> for the ſervice of <hi>Scha-Abbas,</hi> Veſſels of Gold and others, to the value of 260 Millions of <hi>Livers.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> are well proportion'd: have little experience in the Art of Navigation, tho' they be near the Sea.

In the Countrey they have a ſaying, <hi>Bread of</hi> Yeſde-Kaſt, <hi>Wine of</hi> Schiras, <hi>Women of</hi> Yeſde. Their Religion is <hi>Mahometan,</hi> of the Sect of <hi>Hali;</hi> the King allows, that the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> the <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> have their Houſes and Churches in this capital City <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> where the Superiours of thoſe Houſes perform the Function of Ambaſſadours for Chriſtian Princes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue is ſo ſweet and ſoft, that it is in little uſe, but amongſt the Women and Poets; the King, and Perſons of Condition, commonly make uſe of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language. <hi>Perſia</hi> is as a Go-between to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Europeans,</hi> for the Commerce of the <hi>Indies.</hi> It furniſhes the fineſt Silk-ſtuffs, and the beſt Tapeſtries that are ſeen, Cloaths of Gold, Bezoar, Manna, Rhubarb, Roſe-Water,

The greateſt Trade is droven to <hi>Bagdad,</hi> for <hi>Turkey;</hi> to <hi>Gombru,</hi> for the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> do allow of Commerce upon their Coaſts, but ſuffer not any Fortreſſes to be made there: the <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> and other Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Kings, take the ſame courſe in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. They have powerful Neighbours of the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Mogul.</hi> The ſtrength of their State conſiſts principally in its ſituation, there being high Mountains and great Deſarts in its neighbourhood. <hi>Iſmael Sophi</hi> had three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Men in Arms, againſt <hi>Selim,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the <hi>Turks;</hi> the ancient Kings had ſometimes Armies of ſeven or eight hundred thouſand Men.

The <hi>Arabians,</hi> who have no <hi>P</hi> in their Alphabet, call it <hi>Isfaham.</hi> There is a remarkable Tower upon the King's Stables, all built with Goats heads, and other wild Animals, which were taken in one Royal Match of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Caſwin,</hi> or <hi>Casbin,</hi> is eſteemed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> where the King of <hi>Media</hi> dwelt, where <hi>Parmenio</hi> was killed, and <hi>Epheſtion</hi> died, whoſe Funerals coſt above twelve thouſand Talents; that is, twelve thouſand times ſix

The Ruins of this <hi>Perſepolis</hi> are called <hi>Chilminar, i. e.</hi> Forty Columns; which ſeem to be the remains of the Palace of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, the moſt beautiful of all the Eaſt. The Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thoſe Ruins endeavour to deſtroy 'em entirely to free themſelves from the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of ſtrangers, who go to ſee them upon that account. What remains of 'em, ſhews a great antiquity of habits for Perſonages, and an extraordinary magnificence in the ſtones of the building. Thoſe who have ſeen them ſay, that they ſurpaſs the Antiquities of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Wonders of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The abode of <hi>Schiras</hi> is ſo agreeable, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> according to what the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſay, would not go thither, for fear of being charm'd with the Beauty of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and that if he had taſted the delights of that Town, he would have made it his requeſt to God, never to have died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Government of <hi>Schiras,</hi> is the moſt conſiderable of all <hi>Perſia;</hi> it affords excellent Wines, and that Mummy, or Counter-poyſon, which ſerves for Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all manner of Wounds. <hi>Suſa</hi> was the Court of <hi>Ahaſucrus,</hi> and ſome other Kings. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great married <hi>Statira</hi> there; He gave ten thouſand Talents for the acquitting the Debts of thoſe, who had a mind to return into <hi>Greece,</hi> and receiv'd there thirty thouſand young Men of Recruits for his Army. This is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153186:85"/>alſo the place where the fair <hi>Eſther</hi> obtain'd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and where <hi>Mordecai</hi> was put into the place of <hi>Haman,</hi> who was hanged after that he would have caus'd <hi>Mordecai</hi> to have undergone his own Fate. The Palace of <hi>Suſa,</hi> built by <hi>Darius,</hi> is ſaid to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd by <hi>Memnon,</hi> with the Spoils of the great <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and 'tis famed, that the ſtones were cemented with Gold. After <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> it is reckoned amongſt the magnificent Works of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as well as the delicious Gardens of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the younger in <hi>Lydia.

Some believe it the ancient <hi>Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi> where the grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi> having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> transferred the Empire of the <hi>Medes</hi> to the <hi>Perſians.

The Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> towards <hi>Turkey,</hi> have a warlike People, called <hi>Curdes,</hi> whoſe Countrey had been the field of ſeveral Battels: <hi>Alexander</hi> the great overcame <hi>Darius</hi> at <hi>Arbela,</hi> and they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, that there were four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Perſians</hi> killed, and only three hundred

Kirman,</hi> towards the Ocean, yields Wools, and very fine Steel, whereof Arms are made that are in great vogue; a Cymeter of that ſteel does eaſily cut a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met through, without ſtriking hard. <hi>Mogho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> is a Countrey which contains the <hi>Amadizes</hi> and the <hi>Gauls,</hi> very warlike Nations, who have perhaps furniſh'd Matter to make the Fables of <hi>Amadis de Gaule.

The Road is commodious, riding ſafe at anchor in five or ſix fathom Water.

                  <p>THis is the vaſteſt Region of our Continent; Equals in bigneſs all <hi>Europe,</hi> and poſſeſſes all the <hi>Northern</hi> part of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Name of <hi>Tartary,</hi> which has ſucceeded that of <hi>Scythia,</hi> is come from the River <hi>Tatar,</hi> which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> name <hi>Tata,</hi> becauſe they do not make uſe of the Letter <hi>R.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> are a warlike People, the beſt Archers of the World, but cruel and barbarous: they make War almoſt ever to the diſadvantage of thoſe they viſit, and to the confuſion of thoſe who attack them. <hi>Cyrus</hi> at the paſſage of the <hi>Araxes; Darius Hiſtaſpes</hi> in his march againſt the <hi>Scythians</hi> of <hi>Europe; Alexander</hi> the great, when he was beyond the <hi>Oxus,</hi> have been conſtrain'd to yield to the <hi>Tartars:</hi> In our time, the great Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> has been forc'd to own them its Maſters. Their Cavalry does moſt execution in their Battels, on the contrary to what is practiſed in <hi>Europe,</hi> it is it which firſt attacks places. The moſt peaceable of the <hi>Tartars</hi> inhabit Tents of Pelts, and do nothing elſe than look to their Cattel. Their Countrey has in all times been a Nurſery of Men, who under divers Names have made Conqueſts, and eſtabliſh'd Colonies in ſeveral places: That great Wall which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had rais'd for the putting a ſtop to their incurſions, has not been capable of effecting that purpoſe. They aaknowledge ſeveral Princes, whom they call <hi>Cans.</hi> They have ſundry <hi>Hurdes,</hi> that may be called Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:153186:87"/>Camps, Tribes, or Aſſemblies of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The little knowledge we have of them, is the reaſon we call them all under the general Name of <hi>Tartars.</hi> They have the Owl in great veneration, ſince that <hi>Cingis,</hi> one of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, was ſaved by the means of that Bird. They will not ſuffer they ſhould be buried; ſome amongſt 'em make choice of a Tree, and give order for their being hang'd up upon it after their death. There be ſtill among 'em Idolaters, but they are for the moſt part <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans:</hi> It has been obſerv'd, that thoſe who have conquered <hi>China,</hi> have hardly any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Religion, tho' they practice ſeveral Moral Vertues. Five great parts are commonly reckon'd in <hi>Aſian Tartary; Tartaria Deſerta, Giagathi, Turqueſtan, Northern Tartary,</hi> and the <hi>Tartary</hi> of <hi>Kin.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſort Tartary</hi> is ſo called, becauſe that moſt of the Lands there are uncultivated: It is for the moſt part ſubject to the <hi>Czars</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> who draw fine and rich Furrs from thence, and who, with eaſe, ſubdued the Inhabitants of it, they being only Shepherds. Its Gities of <hi>Caſan</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> are near the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which empties it ſelf into the <hi>Caſpian</hi>-Sea by ſeventy Mouths; the <hi>Obi,</hi> which in the ſame Countrey empties it ſelf into the Ocean, has ſix. <hi>Aſtracan</hi> drives a great trade in Salt, which the Inhabitants find in a neighbouring Mountain. The <hi>Calmack</hi> People are Idolaters, much like to the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> by reaſon of their incurſions, their cruelty, and their other ways of living.</p>

Thoſe of <hi>Giagathai</hi> and <hi>Yousbeg</hi> do not call themſelves <hi>Tartars,</hi> being of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion.</p>

                     <hi>Turqueſtan</hi> is the Country, from whence ſome make the <hi>Turks</hi> to come. <hi>Thibet</hi> which is part of it, has <hi>Musk, Cinnamon, Coral</hi> which ſerve for Money to it's Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Kin,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Cathai,</hi> is the moſt Potent State of all <hi>Tartary,</hi> very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, Rich, and full of Great Cities, <hi>Camba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu,</hi> or rather <hi>Muoncheu</hi> is the Capital thereof: Several Authors have told Wonders of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, making it known under the Names of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zai, Xantum, Suntien,</hi> and <hi>Peguim.</hi> Amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, they ſay that in the <hi>Palace</hi> Royal there are twenty four Pillars of fine Gold, and another much greater of the ſame Metal, with a <hi>Pine</hi> Apple beſet with Jewels, that are worth four Great Cities. The Voyage of <hi>Cathai</hi> has been undertaken by ſeveral ways, in hopes of finding <hi>Gold, Musk, Rhubarb,</hi> and other Rich Commodities there; ſeveral have gone thither by the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> others by the <hi>Northern</hi> Sea,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153186:88"/>ſome by going up the <hi>Ganges.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> of this Country invaded <hi>China</hi> in our Time; the King of <hi>Niuche</hi> called <hi>Xunchi,</hi> is the ſame, who made the Conqueſt of it, at the Age of twelve years, aſſiſted with the good and faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of two of his Uncles.

                     <hi>CHina,</hi> which receiv'd almoſt as many Names as it has had Royal Families, has ever paſſ'd for one of the moſt Conſiderable Kingdoms in the World, by reaſon of it's big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Beauty of it's Cities, the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Politeneſs, and Maximes of it's Inhabitants, Printing, the Manufacture of Silks, Artillery, Gunpowder, and Chairs or Sedans, are ſaid to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153186:89"/>have been in uſe with them, ſooner than with us. Beſides what is neceſſary to the Life of Man, <hi>China</hi> produces the moſt precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the Eaſt. It ſeems as if Nature had beſtow'd upon each of it's Provinces ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Gift: thoſe who have dwelt in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do aver, that all that is thought fine, diſpers'd in the reſt of the World, is collected in <hi>China.</hi> That there is likewiſe a vaſt number of things, which would be in vain ſought for elſe-where. So that it is no wonder, if the <hi>Tartars</hi> found it ſo eaſy a matter to ſubdue a Nation, ſubdued in delights before, who having forgot to wear the <hi>ſabre,</hi> contented themſelves with fighting at fiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuffs, and with their Nails, which they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let grow for that purpoſe, and for tearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Flabels and their hair, which was their Principal Ornament. This oblig'd their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to call the <hi>Chineſes, the ſoft and eaſy,</hi> and to make them enjoy the Pleaſures of the Campagne, which they had never done before that Conqueſt. <hi>China</hi> is almoſt Quadrangular; ſo Populous, that there has been ſometimes rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned above Sixty Thouſand Millions of Perſons, of thoſe who might be aſſeſſed and pay Taxes. It's Rivers are ſo covered with Boats, that there are held to be as many as in all the other Rivers of the World. The Annual Revenue of it's King has ever been eſteem'd, a Hundred and Fifty Millions of Gold, according to others, Four Hundred Millions of Ducats; The <hi>Chineſes</hi> laugh'd at our Maps, which plac'd their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at one of the ends of the World; they ſay they are in the mid'ſt, (the <hi>Jews</hi> have pretended the ſame thing for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> for <hi>Granada.</hi>) They ſay alſo,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153186:89"/>that they have two Eyes, that the <hi>Europeans</hi> have but one, and other People none at all. Learned Men are oblig'd to them, for that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled their Hiſtory, which was brought into <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Martini</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit:</hi> It is eſteemed ſo much the more faithful, in that they made it but of their own Country, and only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They have always been ſo Jealous of the ſecrets of their Policy, and of their other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that they did not willingly allow Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers entrance into their Country. The great Wall, or rather the Intrenchment of above four hundred Leagues, which they cauſed formerly to be made, is a Work, that has had more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown than Effect; the <hi>Tartars</hi> have often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run <hi>China,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>this</hi> Obſtacle. Thoſe who have ſaid that <hi>China</hi> is but one City, by reaſon of the Numerouſneſs of it's People, have likewiſe ſaid, that a no leſs conſiderable Wall was requir'd to be proportionable to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of ſuch a Town. 'Tis hardly credible that in this Fortification the Stones be ſeven Fathom high, and five broad, as they are ſaid to be by the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> If we may believe their Hiſtory, the Hoſtilities of the <hi>Tartars</hi> have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed for above four thouſand years; the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> Horſes cannot endure the ſight of thoſe of <hi>Tartary.</hi> The late years have cauſed ſtrange Revolutions in this Kingdome: After that the Rebels had acted as Soveraigns, the <hi>Tartars</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Emperour <hi>Xunchi,</hi> have conquer'd all their Country, in leſs then ſeven years Time, and that ſince the year 1643, the Militia was not very conſiderable, Men of Learning domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd over Men of the Sword: From whence it came, that the State only ſubſiſted by Policy,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153186:90"/>by numerous Armys, and not by the valour of it's People. The principal Chiefs, were called <hi>Mandarins;</hi> at preſent the <hi>Tartar</hi> has <hi>Tartarian</hi> Officers, and <hi>Chineſe</hi> Officers below his Vice-Roys, of whom ſome are for Arms, and others for Learning. This change has the Sword wrought over the Gown, and the poor <hi>Mandarins</hi> are no longer in a ſtate to do Juſtice, with ſo much Pomp and Pride as they formerly did. <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi> is there generally received, nevertheleſs Vertue amongſt them is in an high eſteem. The Publick is more Rich proportionably, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons are: Writing is managed from the top to the bottom: It has above ſixty thouſand Letters, and has not three hundred thouſand Words, which are almoſt all Monoſyllables; whereas the <hi>Europeans</hi> have many Words &amp; few Letters, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have many Letters and few VVords, which they pronounce with divers Tones, according to their ſignification: So as we may ſay, their Speech is only ſinging.

                  <p>All <hi>China</hi> is divided into ſixteen Provinces, each of which are worth more than large King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

This City entertains a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is much diminiſh't; they have no longer two hundred, for a hundred profit, as they had formerly; and now the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have got footing in the Kingdom, whereas they were formerly excluded from thence, becauſe the <hi>Chineſes</hi> had a Propheſie, that they ſhould be ſubdued by people who have <hi>blue Eyes:</hi> This has been verified by the coming of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The Right alone, for the Trade of Salt, is worth every Year above fifteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Livers</hi> to the King of <hi>China.</hi> The ſmall Iſle of <hi>Sanchoan</hi> is known for the death of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Saint <hi>Xavier.

With the River <hi>Jaune,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Channel,</hi> it affords the means of going to <hi>Pekin</hi> by Boat, and of trading to <hi>Pekin</hi> by Rivers, diſembarking only at the Mountain <hi>Muilin.</hi> There is near <hi>Nankin,</hi> a Tower of Porcelain nine Stories, or Vaults, above one another, with a hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and four ſteps. <hi>Schanchay</hi> is the moſt uſual ſtation of the King's Fleets. <hi>Kiamzi</hi> paſſes for the moſt populous Province; It alone has Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proper for the perfection of Porcelain, when they apply to it the Tincture of Azure, Vermilion, or Yellow. The late Voyages, that have been made into the Inlands of <hi>China,</hi> have inform'd us, that Porcelain-Ware is not made of the ſhells of the Sea, nor of Egg-ſhells pounded, as ſeveral have believed; it is made by the means of Sand or Earth, peculiar to certain Cantons of the Countrey, where it is found in Rocks; for the making it, 'tis not neceſſary, that this Earth remain buried an Age, as ſome have thought fit to affirm. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> knead this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153186:91"/>Sand, and make Cups of it, which they ſet a baking in Ovens, for the ſpace of fifteen days, and give them ſeveral Figures. The application of Colours is one of the principal Secrets which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have thought fit to keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from ſtrangers. <hi>Huquam</hi> yields ſo much Rice and Oyl, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have it in a Proverb, That they draw but one Collation from each of the other Provinces of <hi>China,</hi> but from <hi>Huquam</hi> they have wherewith to live on a whole Year. <hi>Xenſi</hi> does particularly furniſh Musk; Its City of <hi>Cancheu</hi> has a great confluence of <hi>Caravans. Siganfu</hi> has very ancient Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Chriſtianity. <hi>Scianſi</hi> hath Vineyards, from whence the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had the Wine they ſtood in need of, for the celebrating the Maſs, before they were driven thence, in the Year 1665. <hi>Honan</hi> produces the beſt Fruits in the World, and in great quantity. <hi>Pekin,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Peguin,</hi> has a City of the ſame Name, the Capital of all the State, with a Caſtle-Royal. It is probably the City, which ſeveral Authors call <hi>Cambalu;</hi> what thoſe Authors call <hi>Cathai,</hi> is nothing elſe than Northern <hi>China.</hi> In the Year 1644. This City was ſurpriz'd, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd, by a Rebel, who diſſipated, in a few days, all the Riches which ſixteen Kings had heaped up, during two hundred and fourſcore Years. Since that, the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Niuche,</hi> whom they call <hi>Kin,</hi> have rendred themſelves Maſters of it; and by the taking of <hi>Nakin,</hi> and <hi>Canton,</hi> have ſetled their Conqueſts in the great Kingdom of <hi>China.</hi>

                  <head>The Empire of the <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Empire comprehends the greateſt part of the firm land of <hi>India</hi> between <hi>Perſia, Tartary</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Mogul</hi> is the Sovereign thereof; He has his Name and his Riſe from a Tribe come from <hi>Giagathai,</hi> a Countrey of <hi>Great Tartary:</hi> He paſſes for the richeſt Prince in the World, as to Jewels; beſides thoſe of his Crown, he has thoſe of ſeveral Princes, his Neighbours, whoſe Predeceſſours had for a long while lived in and entertain'd the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of having 'em: Beſides, he inherits the Jewels of the Grandees of his Court. He is Univerſal Heir to thoſe he gives Penſions to: all Houſes before which he paſſes, owe him a Preſent; the Lands belong to him; his Will ſerves for Law in the deciſion of Matters. In this State, People go under the Name of the Employment they poſſeſs, and not of the Lands they enjoy. Some Relations aſſert, that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch is every day ſhewn part of his Treaſures; ſometimes his Elephants, ſometimes his Jewels, another day ſomewhat elſe; and that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſees every thing but once a Year, all the Treaſure being divided into as many parts, as there are days in the Year. The day of his birth he is weighed, and the feaſting upon that occaſion laſts five days; then he receives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the value of above thirty Millions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething very rare. The Civil War, which aroſe between the four Sons of <hi>Scha-Jehan,</hi> did not allow <hi>Aureng-zebe,</hi> who rendred
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153186:93"/>himſelf Maſter of 'em all, to obſerve punctually theſe Diverſions. One of the Temples of this State is pav'd and imbowed with Plates of pure Gold. In the Palace of <hi>Agra,</hi> there are two Towers cover'd with ſheets of maſſy Gold, and a Throne enrich'd with Jewels, with four Lyons of ſilver Vermilion guilt, ſupporting a Canopy of maſſy Gold. People talk at a much higher rate: He is ſaid to have two Buſhels of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, five Buſhels of Emeralds, twelve Buſhels of diverſe ſorts of Precious Stones, twelve hundred Cutlaſſes, whoſe Scabbards are of Gold, and covered with Jewels. They ſay, moreover, that the Treaſure of <hi>Scha-Choram,</hi> one of the late <hi>Moguls,</hi> was of fifteen hundred Millions of Crowns. What is certain, is, that <hi>Scha-Jehan,</hi> who reign'd near forty Years, left above five Millions of Crowns; that the Throne, which he caus'd to be made in his City of <hi>Jehan-Abad,</hi> which is that of <hi>Delli,</hi> came to above ſixty Millions of Livers. There are ſeven mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Thrones, whereof the greateſt was begun by <hi>Tamerlain.</hi> The Money of this State is of good alloy; great Juſtice is done; the <hi>Europeans</hi> are in great conſideration, being by them call'd <hi>Francs.</hi> They reckon the ways by <hi>Coſſes,</hi> each of which is a Mile and a half. No Oats are allowed their Horſes; they give 'em Peaſe, and a ſort of Paſte made of Sugar, Flour, and Butter. They bathe themſelves in Cyſterns, which they call <hi>Tanques;</hi> in the Rivers there are <hi>Tuberons,</hi> which eat Men. The <hi>Mogul;</hi> upon occaſion, can arm two hundred thouſand Horſe; He has but little Infantry, and that too but bad. He has a conſiderable number of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; of which Creatures he commonly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153186:93"/>keeps five or ſix hundred. He draws great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from theſe Creatures; they are ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, riſe and lye down eaſily, tho' there be of 'em thirteen and fifteen foot high. This Prince is of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sect: Moſt of his Vaſſals are <hi>Pagans.</hi> The <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> have formerly been eſteem'd for Wiſdom in <hi>India,</hi> juſt as are the <hi>Bramins</hi> at this day: The former were very cruel, they cauſed old people, and the diſeaſed, to be killed, out of an opinion, that they did them good ſervice. The <hi>Bramins</hi> exerciſe ſurpriſing Abſtinences, and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſome amongſt 'em will remain ſtanding with their Arms up for ten or twelve Years. They are as the Prieſts of the Countrey. The Troopers and Soldiers are called <hi>Rezbutes.</hi> There are ſeveral <hi>Mahometans</hi> in the Empire of the <hi>Mogul;</hi> Above two thirds there are <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> or <hi>Banians,</hi> or <hi>Perſces.</hi> The <hi>Banians</hi> are almoſt all Merchants, ſharp, cunning, and as ſagacious as poſſible, Huckſters, by reaſon of their acquaintance in the Country, where they live amongſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> do among the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they make profeſſion of doing no hurt to any Creature living; of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the injuries that are done them; they believe the tranſmigration of Souls; have Hoſpitals for Brutes more than for Men. One amongſt 'em, ſpent in one day above twelve thouſand Ducats, for the making the Nuptials of his Friend's Bull: They have a Cow in great veneration. They dare not eat of any thing that has had life, not ſo much as Radiſhes, for fear of eating the Soul of ſome of their Friends. They do not willingly light Candles, for the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153186:94"/>preventing the Gnats from burning themſelves in 'em: When the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who dwell there, have no Money, they endeavour to catch ſome Bird, which they ſhew in the Streets, ſaying, they are going to have it roaſted for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and immediately the <hi>Banians</hi> do not fail to give them Money, to redeem it out of their hands. Marriage is with them in ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that when a young man is dead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having been married, they cauſe ſome Maiden or other to lye with the Body, to whom they give for that purpoſe a Dowry, or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Perſees</hi> are deſcended from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Perſians,</hi> who retired into thoſe parts: Never any of 'em are Farriers, or Lockſmiths, for fear of being ſometimes obliged to put out the Fire, which they eſteem their God; They have ſuch a reverence for Wood, as the Fewel and Nouriſhment of that God, that, not to prophane it by touching of the dead, they make their Coffins of Iron. The <hi>Indians</hi> in general are tawny, Olive-colour'd, with lank, black Hair; If there be any Whites, their whiteneſs is a mark of Leproſie. They drink from on high, or pour it in without touching the Cup with their lips: they affect white in their Buildings; they ride on Oxen, inſtead of Horſes: Perſons of quality, who travel in theſe Countreys, cauſe a kind of Cornet, or Enſign, to be carried before them. Their way of ſalutation, is to take one another by the Beard. If they be diſtant from Court, they ſuffer their hair to grow, as a token of their diſcontent, in that they are deprived of the happineſs of ſeeing their Prince.</p>

                     <hi>India</hi> is very fertile and populous in thoſe parts, that confine upon its great Rivers; It has ſome Countreys, where you muſt go in good company, if you mean to ſave your ſelf from Robbers, whom they call <hi>Koulis.</hi> It is fine to ſee the High-ways of two hundred Leagues in length, which reſemble Walks or Alleys; they are planted with Cocoes, Dates, and Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees. This Countrey miniſters excellent Bread, there being Corn and Rice in abundance. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals in general are mighty cheap in theſe parts, and nevertheleſs the Inhabitants are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very ſober. The neighbourhood of <hi>Tartary</hi> is full of Mountains and Foreſts, where the <hi>Moguldoes</hi> often take the divertiſement of Hunting: there is a great number of wild Beaſts, and Rats too, who attack Men in their Beds. Here it was, that <hi>Alexander</hi> made Timber to be cut for the building of Ships, which he cauſed to deſcend down the <hi>Indus,</hi> and upon the Ocean, whoſe ebbing and flowing did extraordinarily ſurpriſe his Pilots. As for the remains of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in this State, there are very few, the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls</hi> having made it their bus'neſs to ruin the ancient Towns. The <hi>Indus</hi> is navigable from the <hi>Lahor,</hi> as far as <hi>Sind.</hi> The People of the Countrey call it <hi>Pang-ab,</hi> by reaſon of the five Rivers, which aſſemble in the higheſt part of its courſe. The <hi>Ganges,</hi> which is ſmall and low, when there is no Rain, was formerly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its Gold; it is ſo at preſent for its Water, which is very light. The Natives of the Countrey ſay, that this Water ſanctifies them, whether they drink of it, or waſh in't; they go in Pilgrimage to the places where it paſſes: the <hi>Moguls</hi> always cauſe ſome of it to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153186:95"/>be carried with them. It is fine to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four or five hundred thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> in one and the ſame ſeaſon round this <hi>Ganges,</hi> wherein ſeveral go to caſt Gold and Silver. The Cuſtom of ſome is to hide it under ground, in the opinion they have, it may ſerve them after their death.</p>
                  <p>There are full forty Kingdoms in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whereof all the Names are almoſt the ſame with thoſe of the capital Cities. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome ſmall Territories there are, whoſe Lords, who call themſelves <hi>Rajas,</hi> are of a very ancient Race, and maintain themſelves in Fortreſſes and Mountains inacceſſible. The greateſt miſchief they do, is to rob and make incurſions upon the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Subjects: The Names of ſome Cities, terminating in <hi>Pore,</hi> ſeem to ſhew, that they ſtill preſerve the Memory of <hi>Porus;</hi> as well as others in <hi>Scander,</hi> that of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The Dominions of the <hi>Mogul</hi> are much larger than thoſe of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and equal thoſe of the <hi>Turk.</hi> The <hi>Mogul</hi> prevails by the number of his Subjects, by the vaſtneſs of his Riches, by the extent of his Empire: His Revenue exceeds thoſe both of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and <hi>Sophi</hi> together. The <hi>Sophi</hi> ſurpaſſes him in Arms, in Horſes, and Soldiers. The <hi>Mogul</hi> keeps good correſpondence with the <hi>Turk,</hi> in conſideration both of State and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>Guzaratta</hi> yields every year about eight Millions of Gold, and its Merchants paſs for the ableſt and moſt ſagacious of all <hi>India.</hi> This Province has three ſtately Cities, <hi>Amad-abad, Cambaya,</hi> and <hi>Surat,</hi> with thirty other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Towns. <hi>Amad-abad,</hi> the Capital, is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as much as <hi>London. Cambaia</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:153186:95"/>was called the <hi>Cairo</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> by reaſon of its bigneſs, which is two Leagues in circuit; by reaſon of its Commerce, and the fertility of its Soyl, which furniſhes, amongſt other things, Cotton, Anir, Opium, Agates, whereof there is a Mine at <hi>Baroche:</hi> Since the loſſes of the <hi>Portugals, Cambaya</hi> is much decayed; beſides, that its Haven is very bad. <hi>Surat,</hi> forty ſix days journey from the Royal City of <hi>Agra,</hi> is one of the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> Cities, which drives the greateſt Trade, tho' the coming to it be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the Houſes low, and cover'd with Palm-trees. Its River abates much, which is four Leagues below the Town, can hardly carry Veſſels of ſeventy or eighty Ton; they being oblig'd to unlade the Merchandizes at <hi>Sohali:</hi> This is the principal Scene of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the <hi>East-Indies:</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have ſetled a Conſul there for the ſame purpoſe. It is now about thirteen years ago, that this City was plunder'd by a <hi>Raja</hi> of the Countrey, a Rebel of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> called <hi>Siva-Gi,</hi> the loſs ariſing to above thirty-Millions. This <hi>Siva-Gi</hi> has, ſince that, taken ſeveral Towns to the South of <hi>Surat. Diu</hi> is a Fortreſs in an Iſland, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> have been forced to abandon, after having gloriouſly defended it in the years 1539, and 1546. One of their Soldiers is ſaid to have ſhewn ſuch bravery there, that wanting Lead, he pull'd out his great Teeth for the charging his Musket: on the other ſide, an <hi>Indian</hi> being ſtruck with the Pike of a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> advanc'd and thruſt it on ſo far into his own body, until that he came up to his enemy, and ſlaſh'd his hamms for him with his ſhort Sword. There is mention made, in the War
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:153186:96"/>of <hi>Flanders,</hi> of ſomewhat the like bravery: A Soldier, hidden in a Boats of Turffs, for the ſurpriſing of <hi>Breda,</hi> having receiv'd a Wound from the Pike of thoſe who ſearch'd it, had the reſolution and cunning, to wipe the Iron and end of the Pike, for fear his blood ſhould diſcover the Enterprize. <hi>Cabul,</hi> with a Town of the ſame Name, is fruitful in Myrobalan Plums. <hi>Candahar</hi> was conquer'd and taken from the <hi>Perſian,</hi> but reſtored to him in the year 1650, and the <hi>Moguls</hi> have not been able to retake it. <hi>Agra</hi> has the capital City of all the Dominions, where might be raiſed, upon occaſion, two hundred thouſand Men, capable of bearing Arms: it is likewiſe the greateſt City of the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Prince draws a great Revenue, from eight hundred Stoves that are there. 'Tis twice as large as <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> but ill built, and without Walls; It's much augmented ſince the year 1566: That <hi>Ecbar</hi> made it his Reſidence, after having caus'd there a ſtately Caſtle to be raiſed. <hi>Delli</hi> was the abode of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> before <hi>Agra,</hi> and is ſo ſtill, ſince that <hi>Cha-Jean</hi> has built the City of <hi>Jean-Abad</hi> in its neighbourhood. <hi>Gualeor</hi> is a Fortreſs, where the <hi>Mogul</hi> confines ſuch of the Princes of his Blood, as give him any umbrage. <hi>Lahor,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to by the Caravans, is the ancient <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalea,</hi> and is ſaid to be twenty four Leagues in compaſs. <hi>Naugracut</hi> has a famous Idol; thoſe who go thither, out of devotion, cut a piece of their Tongue off. <hi>Kachmire,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Caſſimere,</hi> is eſteemed the little Paradiſe of <hi>India,</hi> upon the account of its beauty. <hi>Chitor,</hi> a ruin'd City, was the Capital of <hi>Ruana,</hi> the Succeſſour of <hi>Porus. Bengala</hi> is renowned for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153186:96"/>the temprature of its Air, its fruitful Soyl, the abundance of its Rice, which moſt parts of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> furniſh themſelves with, for its fine Canes or Reeds, its Silks, &amp; its excellent Wood of <hi>Calamba,</hi> the rareſt and of the moſt agreeable ſcent in the World.

It has above fifty Kings, the moſt powerful of whom, do, by little and little, encroach upon the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the others. The <hi>Portugals, Engliſh,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> have Towns near the Sea, with Fortreſſes, for the ſecurity of Trade, which is commonly of Spices, Jewels, Pearls, and Cotton-Cloth.

There blows, in Winter, a Wind which ſo moves the neighbouring Sea, that it rouls a vaſt quantity of the Sand into the Entrance of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153186:97"/>the Harbours, ſo as then ſmall Barks cannot come in: In Summer, another Wind, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is ſo violent, that it carries away the Sand clearly, and lays open the Navigation. The great number of Rivers there, renders Horſes of little uſe, principally for War. Thoſe Rivers fatten the Land, nouriſh Crocodiles, whoſe fleſh is good to eat, and ſerve for the tranſportation of Victuals and Spiceries. The <hi>Malabarians</hi> paſs a whole day without eating, by taking two Grains of a Paſte, called <hi>Anfian,</hi> which they have come from <hi>Cambaia:</hi> they are oblig'd to continue this nouriſhment, and if they once left it off, they could not live four days to an end. The Children in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey do not ſucceed their Fathers; thoſe of their Siſters inherit, as being certainly the next of Blood.

                  <p>THere be ſeveral Iſlands known under this name. The three moſt conſiderable, are <hi>Niphon, Ximo</hi> and <hi>Xicoco.

                  <p>All theſe Iſlands have a temperate Air; abound in Rice, Pearls, and Mines of Silver, very much eſteemed. Their Pearls are large, but are found to have too much of Red in them. In this Country is a very extraordinary Tree; it becomes dry when they wet it, and to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, they muſt put into a hole they make in it, filings of Iron, with Sand very dry: and to make its Branches green, and gain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert its Leaves, they are to be faſtened with a Nail.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Japaneſes</hi> are Idolaters, good Soldiers, and very patient: Notwithſtanding the dangers of the neighbouring Sea, they have ſometimes taken the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Corca</hi> from the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> They have the moſt happy memories in the World, and a very abounding Tongue; for each thing they have ſeveral names, ſome for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, others of Honour: ſome for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, others for the People. Their Cuſtoms and Manners are wholly contrary to ours: They drink Warm water, and they give this reaſon for their ſo doing, that the Cold is binding, provokes Coughing, and the Diſtempers of the Stomach; but that the Warm nouriſhes the Natural heat of the Body, that the paſſages are opened by it, and that the thirſt is the more eaſily quenched. They give ſuch Potions to the Sick, as are very ſweet and odoriferous: They never let Blood, becauſe they would ſpare their Blood as the Vehicle of Life: They eſteem black Teeth the fineſt: They mount on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back on the right ſide: Salute by a ſhaking of the Feet. To treat the King of <hi>Japan,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>Cube</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> three Years are ſaid to be required for Preparations, and that the Feaſts laſt full three Months.</p>

                  <p>They have ſeveral particular <hi>Tones,</hi> or Princes, the moſt part of whom, confine their Power within the Circle of a Town.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:153186:108"/>ſince they were engaged to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who laid claim to 'em, as having been there by the common way, which was that of the Eaſt.

The ſtate of this Prince would be pretty temperate, if the heats were not inſupportable in the day time.

Their ancient Courſe was to go firſt of all into <hi>Great Canary,</hi> or into <hi>Gomera;</hi> to ſail towards the South or the South-Eaſt, there to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Monzoons, or General Winds of the Torrid Zone, which carried them to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloupe,</hi> where they met with good Water.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:153186:115"/>Now adays, becauſe they have two Fleets, the one for <hi>New Spain,</hi> the other, which is call'd the <hi>Gallions,</hi> for the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> after having ſteered much the ſame Courſe, theſe Fleets di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves at their departure from the moſt Eaſtern of the <hi>Antille's Iſlands:</hi> that of <hi>New-Spain</hi> makes for the <hi>Cape St. Anthony,</hi> in the Weſtern part of the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and then gets to the Port of <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> by a Northern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courſe in Winter, by a Southern Courſe in Summer. From thence the Merchants go by Land to the City <hi>de los Angelos,</hi> and to <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Port of <hi>Vera Cruz</hi> is defended by a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, it is much more ſo by the Flats and Rocks which are at its entrance. About three Months time is ſpent in the way from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Vera Cruz.</hi> The Ships, which are bound for the <hi>Honduras</hi> and <hi>Guatimala,</hi> after having ſail'd South of the Iſle of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> ſteer to the North of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and diſembark at <hi>Truxillo,</hi> or at the <hi>Golfo Dulce,</hi> which are places of the Province of <hi>Honduras.</hi> Thoſe who go to the <hi>Manilhes,</hi> after being arriv'd in the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> go and embark at the Port of <hi>Acapulco,</hi> or in that of <hi>Natividad,</hi> both upon the South-Sea. They bring from the <hi>Manilhes</hi> much Riches, and far more precious Merchandizes, than thoſe which are carried from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Port of <hi>Acapulco</hi> is ſpacious, ſheltered from Winds, defended with a Caſtle, and about fourſcore Leagues diſtant from the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which ſends its Merchandizes upon Mules.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet of <hi>Cartagena,</hi> after having paſs'd in fight of the Iſlands, ſteers it Courſe towards <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where it diſembarks for the new

                  <p>To return into <hi>Europe,</hi> theſe Fleets aſſemble all at the <hi>Havana,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> the beſt Harbour of the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> 'Tis very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and defended with three Caſtles.

                  <p>Moſt of the Countreys of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> are the fineſt, the moſt delicious, and, without contradiction, the richeſt of the whole World. The <hi>Europeans,</hi> who go by Sea, have ſought out all imaginable ways to get thither with eaſe, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> happily effected in the foregoing Age: the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves ſo powerful in thoſe Parts, in our time, that they would fain play there the Maſters of Commerce: But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought fitting to ſhare with 'em in it: And the <hi>French</hi> have ſhewn, what a willing mind they have that way, if they had but all the Qualities neceſſary for ſuch like Enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> Tongue is in uſe upon the Coaſts of the <hi>East-Indies:</hi> When that People return into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> through the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Turk,</hi> they lay aſide that Tongue at <hi>Bagdad,</hi> to make uſe of <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> which is <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and a corrupted <hi>Italian.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> at their going out of the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> ſteer towards the South-Eaſt, unto the heighth of Cape <hi>Finiſterre</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> Thence they go Southerly, paſſing into the Eaſt, and in ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Madera,</hi> or much rather to the Eaſt of that of <hi>Porto-Santo.</hi> They come in ken of the Iſle of <hi>Palma,</hi> one of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> when they are about ten Leagues Weſtward. They paſs alſo ſometimes between <hi>Teneriff,</hi> and the great <hi>Canary;</hi> then they muſt carefully avoid the Flat of the <hi>Savages,</hi> to the South of <hi>Porto-Santo:</hi> there are ſeveral ſmall Iſlands conſidered as a Bank, becauſe they are environ'd with Rocks. Afterwards they ſtill ſteer their Courſe towards the South, and paſs between the Iſles of <hi>Cap-Verd,</hi> and the <hi>Terra
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:153186:117"/>firma</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> about thirty or forty Leagues Eaſt of thoſe Iſlands. They do not approach nearer than a hundred Leagues to the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> by reaſon the Currents of the Sea bear thither, and that there are troubleſom Calms; nor do they come nearer the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> than they do that of <hi>Guinea,</hi> for the avoiding the <hi>Abrolhes,</hi> which begin towards the Iſle St. <hi>Catherina;</hi> if they did otherwiſe, they would find themſelves obliged to return into <hi>Europe.</hi> They ſteer a middle Courſe between the Iſle of <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and that of <hi>Trinity,</hi> which are at twenty Degrees of Southern Latitude. After which, they go towards the South-Eaſt, until that in thirty two Degrees of the ſame Southern Latitude, they be on the North of the Iſles of <hi>Triſtan de Cunha,</hi> which they dare not come near, becauſe the Sea is commonly very high there: theſe Iſlands are ſeven in number, and one of 'em is much greater than the reſt. By ſteering after that, Eaſt South-Eaſt, they meet with the ſigns of the Cape of Good Hope, which are of a green Herb, called Sargaſs, and of Trombes, which are pieces of Reeds, of three or four Foot in length, as thick as a Man's arm, lying upon the Water with their Roots. They are uſed to paſs to ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Cape <hi>des Aiguilles,</hi> that they can ſound the Bank, which is in the South of it.

                  <p>The return into <hi>France,</hi> is performed after another manner than the way they go from thence, by reaſon of the General Winds which reign from the Eaſt Weſt-wardly in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> as we have ſaid. After having doubled the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> and been ſome hundred Leagues to the Eaſt, they purſue the Courſe North North-Eaſt, unto the ſixteenth Degree of Southern Latitude; from whence, they go directly Weſt to ken the Iſland of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> where they are uſed to refreſh themſelves: the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have made there a Fort ſome few years ſince. From the Iſle of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> they go to the Iſle of <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> where they have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Fiſhing for <hi>Tortoiſe;</hi> and then ſtill towards the North-Eaſt, until they come to the height of <hi>France.</hi> In their return, when they are ſomewhat on this ſide the Line, they leave the <hi>Panedo</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> on the left: After that, they leave the Iſles of <hi>Cape-Verd</hi> on the right, as well as the <hi>Tercera</hi>'s, and are very cautious of approaching the <hi>Abrolhes,</hi> which lye on the Weſt of thoſe Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> go to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> by the South of the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope;</hi> their Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea is regulated by certain Seaſons, and the Winds they call <hi>Mueſſons.</hi> After having doubled that famous Cape, they bend their Courſe for <hi>Goa,</hi> between the firm Land of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Iſland <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:153186:118"/>the Eaſt or to the Weſt of the Shores of <hi>India.</hi> They go to refreſh themſelves at <hi>Mozambick,</hi> and paſs between the Iſles <hi>Comorro,</hi> and <hi>Juan-Miz;</hi> then, ſtill to the North-Eaſt, unto the ſixteenth Degree of Northern Latitude, in the diſtance of about a hundred Leagues from the Deſart Coaſt. At length they ſteer directly Eaſt for <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they go from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Macao,</hi> they they make Sail along <hi>Malabar</hi> towards the Cape of <hi>Comorin;</hi> South of <hi>Ceilan,</hi> and of all the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Iſlands: They paſs through the Streights which are near the Iſland <hi>Galli,</hi> and Sail along <hi>Macaſar</hi> and the <hi>Manilhes,</hi> unto <hi>Macao.</hi> This they do not without great inconveniencies; and they take that great Circuit, becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hinder them from paſſing between the Streights of <hi>Malacca</hi> and <hi>Sunda,</hi> nay, and often ſcout 'em towards <hi>Cochim,</hi> and at the Point of <hi>Galle</hi> upon the Coaſt of the Iſle of <hi>Ceilan.</hi> The Navigation from <hi>Macao</hi> to <hi>Japan</hi> is about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days.</p>
                  <p>In their return, at their departure from <hi>Goa,</hi> they paſs by the Cape to the Weſt, about a hundred and fifty Leagues, and come in ken of the Deſart Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and in ſight of Land, and get to <hi>Mozambick,</hi> making Sail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Iſle of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> and the Shores of <hi>India:</hi> they Coaſt along the Land of <hi>Natal,</hi> where the Currents are commonly from the North-Eaſt to the South-Weſt, and where the Navigation is very dangerous. After which, they return into <hi>Portugal</hi> by the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> following the above-mention'd Courſe.</p>

                  <p>The Courſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> often take to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> is by the South of the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope.</hi> They go thither ſometimes through the Streights of <hi>le Maire</hi> and <hi>Brovers.</hi> They take that way by reaſon of the Winds motion of the Water, which they have then favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Sayling towards the Weſt, and becauſe commonly they ſpend leſs time, and loſe fewer Men in this than in the other way. When by the South of <hi>Africa,</hi> they go and double the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> they after touch at the Bay they call <hi>Tafel-Bay.</hi> This Bay is a commodious Retreat for Ships, they can Anchor there, with all ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at ſix or eight Fathom Water, and ſhelter themſelves from the Storms, which are very frequent in thoſe parts. The Air is healthful; they find all ſorts of refreſhments, excellent Water; the acceſs to it is ſo eaſie, that they can take in freſh Water without any trouble. For theſe conſiderations, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made an Eſtabliſhment there ſome years ſince, and no longer content themſelves, as they formerly did, with leaving Letters there for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, that might come to paſs that way. The Mountain of <hi>Tafel-Bay</hi> is eſteemed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and fifty Foot high. Thoſe <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> who do not ſtop at <hi>Tafel-Bay,</hi> make for <hi>Mauritius</hi>-Iſland, otherwiſe <hi>Swan</hi>-Iſland. This Iſland has, in its Southern part, a Port between the Flats, wherein above fifty great Ships may ride ſafe under the ſhelter of a Fort built in the Year 1640. From thence, between divers Flats, they make for the Chanel of <hi>Mamale,</hi> or that of <hi>Malique;</hi> and in this laſt Courſe, they have favourable Currents.</p>

Sometimes they go through the Deſart to go to thoſe two Cities, from whence they go to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paham</hi> and to <hi>Agra</hi> by Caravans; or elſe, after being Embark'd upon the <hi>Tigris,</hi> they go to <hi>Congue</hi> and <hi>Gombru</hi> near <hi>Ormus,</hi> by the Sea <hi>El-Catif;</hi> and into the <hi>East-Indies</hi> by the Ocean.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:153186:120"/>The Cuſtoms of the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> gain very much by the Merchandizes, which take this way. The Carriage from <hi>Bagdad</hi> to <hi>Baſſora</hi> is very eaſie and pleaſant; in the Barks, which go that way, they ſometimes make uſe of Sails, and ſometimes Oars; often do they let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be carried along by the Current and Stream of the Water, ſo as they only Steer. The River, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood call <hi>Chat</hi> or <hi>Xat,</hi> as they do the other Great Rivers, is two Miles in breadth, and about ſix Fathom deep.

This way is look'd upon as much the ſame with that from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to <hi>Alexandretta.</hi> At <hi>Surat</hi> they take their Way by Land, ſpend therein forty ſmall days Journies, as far as <hi>Mazulpatan,</hi> a City up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gulph of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and this about the Month of <hi>March.</hi> From <hi>Mazulpatan</hi> they go

                  <p>They make mention of another way to <hi>China,</hi> thro' <hi>Candahar, Agra, Pathna, Niepal, Pitan,</hi> &amp;c. this way is gone by Land; no Inn to be found, few Villages, great Deſarts, hideous Mountains, where they make uſe of great Goats to carry their things.

                  <p>TThe Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is, at this day, one of the moſt flouriſhing States of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the midſt of the Northern temperate Zone, where its People breath a very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Air. The <hi>French</hi> call it the Eye and Pearl of the World; and ſay, that it is to <hi>Europe</hi> what <hi>Europe</hi> is to other parts of the Earth: it is Rich, Fertile, very Populous, there being reckoned above four thouſand good Towns in it. It's above two hundred and twenty Leagues in length, and full as many in breadth. The <hi>French-men</hi> value moſt of their Towns to be worth Provinces, their Provinces to be worth Kingdoms. Their Corn, Wine, Salt and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, do very much enrich the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> was formerly known under the name
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:153186:121"/>of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which was carried into ſeveral places of <hi>Europe,</hi> nay, into <hi>Aſia,</hi> when the <hi>Gauls</hi> made War in that part of the World. The extent of <hi>Gaul</hi> hath been divers. The <hi>French</hi> may well boaſt, that this King's Conqueſts have not been bounded neither by the <hi>Rhine,</hi> nor the <hi>Ocean,</hi> nor the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> nor the <hi>Alps.</hi> The Crown is Hereditary; and, according to the Salick Law, the Female never ſucceeds upon the Throne. The <hi>French</hi> King's eldeſt Son is called <hi>Dauphin.</hi> This Monarchy is ſaid to have ſubſiſted ſince the Year 420. The three Royal Races of <hi>Merovers, Charlemaigne, Hugh Capet,</hi> have furniſhed it with ſixty five Kings. Amongſt other Titles, its Princes take upon them that of Moſt Chriſtian, and Eldeſt Son of the Church. They pretend to Precedence before all other Kings, upon a pretext of being the moſt Noble and the Moſt Ancient of <hi>Europe.</hi> Their Arms are <hi>Azure,</hi> with three <hi>Flower-de-luces d' Or,</hi> ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom is compoſed of three Orders or States, the Clergy, the Nobility, and the third Eſtate. There are reckoned ſeventeen Arch-Biſhopricks, a hundred and ſix Biſhopricks, beſides the Arch-Biſhopricks of <hi>Cambray, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanzon,</hi> the Biſhopricks of <hi>Arras,</hi> St. <hi>Omar, Tournay, Ipres, Perpignan;</hi> ſixteen Abbayes, Heads of the Order, or of the Congregation: about fifty thouſand Curates, beſides other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Dignities: ſeveral General and Particular Governments: Thirty two great Provinces: Twelve ancient Peerages, ſeveral of new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A great number of Principalities, Dutchies, Marquiſates, Counties, Baronies, and other Lordſhips; Eleven Parliaments, beſides thoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:153186:122"/>of the Conquer'd Countrys, eight Chambers of Accounts, twenty two Generalities.</p>
                  <p>There are four Principal Rivers, the <hi>Seine,</hi> whoſe Water is eſteem'd the ſtrongeſt in the World, and more healthful to drink than that of Fountains; the <hi>Loire,</hi> the King of the <hi>French</hi> Rivers; <hi>la Garonne,</hi> the moſt Navigable; the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> the moſt Rapid.</p>
                  <p>Several Diviſions are made of <hi>France,</hi> which regard the Church, the Nobility, the Juſtice, and the Finances. It is ſufficient to ſay here, that the States-General of the Kingdom were held in the Year 1614. that then all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appear'd under twelve Great Governments; four of thoſe Governments are towards the North, the <hi>Seine,</hi> and the Rivers which fall into it, <hi>Picardy, Normandy,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Champaign.</hi> Four towards the midſt, near the <hi>Loire, Brittany, Orleanois, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Lyonnois.</hi> The four others, towards the South, and near the <hi>Garonne</hi> or the <hi>Roſne, Guyenne, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, Dauphine, Provence.</hi> With <hi>Orleanois</hi> they then conjoyned <hi>le Mains, le Perche, la Beauce,</hi> on this ſide the River of <hi>Loire; Nivernois, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Anjoy,</hi> above the ſaid River; beyond it, <hi>Poictou, Angoumois, Berri. Burgundy</hi> had <hi>la Breſſe,</hi> as it has ſtill at preſent. Under <hi>Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> were <hi>Lyonnois, Avergne, Bourbonnois, la Marche.</hi> In <hi>Guyenne</hi> was <hi>Bearne, Gaſcogne,</hi> true <hi>Guyenne</hi> beyond the <hi>Garonne;</hi> and on this ſide <hi>Saintogne, Perigort, Limoſin, Querci, Rouergue.</hi> Then, as well as now, <hi>Languedoc</hi> comprehended <hi>Cevenes.</hi> The other great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are not ſubdivided into great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.

                     <hi>SPain</hi> is a Great <hi>Peninſula,</hi> two hundred Leagues in length, and the ſame in breadth, in the moſt Weſtern part of <hi>Europe,</hi> betwixt the ninth and twenty fourth Degree of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, and between thirty five Degrees and a half, and forty Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude. This <hi>Peninſula</hi> is upon the Ocean, and upon the Mediterranean-Sea; towards the North-Eaſt, it borders upon <hi>France,</hi> for the ſpace of above a hundred Leagues, the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains between both.</p>
                  <p>Several things concur to the making <hi>Spain</hi> thinly inhabited; its Fertility, Mountains, the barrenneſs of its Women, the baniſhment of the Moors, of whom above eight hundred thouſand were conſtrain'd to depart thence, in the Year 1610, the great number of perſons that are ſent to Colonies, and the Wars abroad. From whence it proceeds, that never above ſeven thouſand natural <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ever ſeen together in any Army. The Heat reigns there more than the Cold; thoſe Provinces which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:153186:123"/>lye South-Eaſt, are more fertile than the reſt. The Mountains without Trees, and the mighty Rocks are there called <hi>Sierra.</hi> This Country has but ſcarcity of Corn, but abounds with the ſtrongeſt Wines, the moſt delicious Fruits, and the ſweeteſt Oyls of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Gold and Silver, which is brought into <hi>Spain</hi> from <hi>America,</hi> is very capable of purchaſing it all the other Conveniencies of Life. In the Year 1618. it was verified, that ſince the firſt diſcovery of this New World by <hi>Columbus,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had drawn from thence above fifteen hundred thirty ſix Millions of Gold. Theſe are immenſe Sums, but, as the Traders of <hi>Europe</hi> have the beſt ſhare in them, they have not enrich'd <hi>Spain,</hi> proportionably to what it has been weakned by the Colonies, that have been ſent thither. Moreover, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of having foreign Commodities drains and exhauſts the better part of thoſe Riches. This made <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Piſtolls ſpoke their Riches in their own Dominions, but, carried elſewhere, did but ſhew their Poverty.</hi> Mines there are of Copper, Quick-ſilver, Lead, Iron, and Salt, in <hi>Spain:</hi> thoſe of Gold and Silver have been ſpared, ſince they have had the conveniency of thoſe of <hi>America.</hi> The Horſes of this Region are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in eſteem, thoſe of <hi>Andalouſia</hi> above all others; yet they travel commonly in this Countrey upon Mules and Aſſes, by reaſon of the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>No Prince whatſoever has ſo much Land, as the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> He may, with juſtice, ſtyle himſelf the greateſt Territorian of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, if I may uſe that Term. True it is,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153186:123"/>that his Dominions lye ſeparated from one another, and diſpers'd in the four parts of the World. Some of his Predeceſſours have boaſted, that the Sun never ſet in their Dominions, and that the extent of their Territories was only to be meaſured by the Courſe of that Planet. In ſome Letters, which the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> have addreſs'd to them in the foregoing Age, there is, <hi>To the King, who has the Sun for a Hat.</hi> Among other Titles, they wear that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> particularly ſince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Fifth, and that of the King of <hi>Spains;</hi> they have taken up this laſt but of late years. Theſe following are thoſe which <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth took in the <hi>Pleinpouvoir,</hi> which he gave in the Year 1659, to <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> for the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.

                  <p>The principal Order of Knighthood, in <hi>Spain,</hi> is that of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> the others are thoſe of St. <hi>James,</hi> of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantara,</hi> and <hi>Monteſe:</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:153186:124"/>attributed to themſelves great Maſterſhips and Juriſdictions of 'em, under the Name of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Adminiſtrators.

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> eſteem Arts as diſnonourable; upon which account moſt of their Artificers are ſtrangers. They have always maintain'd the reputation, of being Faithful and Loyal to their Prince; they are ſlow in their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their Tediouſneſs and Procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes them often loſe good Occaſions. Some of 'em have the vanity to ſay, That their Country furniſhes the World with Generals of Armies; That God ſpoke to <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Tongue; That the Lord of the Univerſe muſt be a <hi>Spaniard</hi> born, and other ſuch great Words.</p>

                     <hi>Spain,</hi> ſometimes called <hi>Iberia, Heſperia, Mus-Arabia,</hi> was ſubject to ſtrangers during a long while: the <hi>Celtae, Rhodiots, Phenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Swabians, Goths,</hi> and the <hi>Moors,</hi> have commanded and domineer'd there, over all, or in ſome parts. Its firſt Diviſion was into two parts; the one on this ſide, the other on that ſide the <hi>Ebre,</hi> which then bounded the Empires of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage;</hi> ſince, what has been called <hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:153186:124"/>
                     <hi>Grenada.</hi> After which, the whole Country fell under the ſway of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> It is principally by theſe three Titles, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has poſſeſs'd all his States, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are eight Vice-Roy-ſhips. In our time the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> has been a peaceable Poſſeſſour of all theſe Kingdoms, tho', that ſince <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the Succeſſion of theſe Kingdoms has fallen ten times upon Females: In the Year 1640, <hi>Portugal</hi> proclaim'd the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>The principal Rivers of <hi>Spain,</hi> are the <hi>Douere,</hi> abounding in Fiſh; the <hi>Tagus,</hi> renowned for its golden Sands; <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which is ſaid to run under Ground; <hi>Guadalquiber</hi> is the deepeſt; <hi>Iberus,</hi> famous for its Name: All of them have their Source in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and are not Navigable, like many Rivers in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. <hi>Guadiana</hi> has given the <hi>Spaniards</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay, That their Land affords the richeſt Bridge upon Earth; that it daily feeds above ten thouſand Cattel, and that a great Army may march over it in Battalia: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſeem to have admirably well called this River <hi>Anas,</hi> by reaſon that it enters and riſes out of the Earth, as a Duck does in the water. Some Moderns ſay, this River is hidden by the Mountains; others do aſſure us, that theſe are Breakings up of the Ground, which are made for the watering the neighbouring Lands, that are very lean and hungry: Certain it is, that this happens towards the Sources of <hi>Guadiana,</hi> and not towards <hi>Merida,</hi> as the old Carts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it. This is one of the Wonders of <hi>Spain;</hi> the two others are, a City incircled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:153186:125"/>with Fire by Walls of Flint, which is <hi>Madrid;</hi> a Bridge, over which Water is ſeen to run; which is the Aqueduct of <hi>Segovia.</hi> One may ſay of the Cities of this State, that they have ſome appellation for Excellence; <hi>Sevil</hi> the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Grenada</hi> the great, <hi>Valencia</hi> the fair, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellonna</hi> the rich, <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> the ſatisfied, <hi>Valle do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi> the Genteel, <hi>Toledo</hi> the ancient, <hi>Madrid</hi> the Royal City.

                  <p>There are reckoned in <hi>Spain</hi> fifteen great Parts, moſt of which had the Title of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the times of the <hi>Moors:</hi> Five upon the Ocean, <hi>Biſcaya, Aſturia, Galicia, Portugal,</hi> that hath its King, <hi>Andalouſia:</hi> Five upon the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean-Sea, Granada, Murcia, Valencia, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorca;</hi> Five within the Inland of the Country, <hi>Aragon, Navarre,</hi> the two <hi>Caſtiles, Leon.</hi>

                     <hi>Andalouſia</hi> is ſo beautiful, ſo abounding in Wines, Corn, Olives, that it paſſes for the Granary and Store-houſe-of the Kingdom. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> is the Magazine of the Riches of the New-World: 'Tis a Town ſo well Built, that there is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb which runs, <hi>Qui en no ha viſto Sevilla, no ha viſto maravilla.</hi> It ſtill keeps the remains of the City <hi>Italica,</hi> the Native Town of <hi>Adrian.</hi>

Its principal Church was formerly the greateſt Moſque of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> after that of <hi>Mecca. San-Lucar,</hi> at the Mouth of <hi>Guadalquivir,</hi> is a Town of great Trade. The Ships, which bring Gold and Silver from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> have ſometimes caſt Anchor near the Tower of the Port, which is ſometimes call'd the Tower of Gold: This caſting Anchor is more commonly performed at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the Port Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> which is near it. <hi>Xeres de la Fontera</hi> is in the Neighbourhood of the Place where the <hi>Moors</hi> entirely defeated the <hi>Goths,</hi> in the Year 712. After which, they had the means of Ravaging all <hi>Spain</hi> as they did. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been obſerv'd to have made no ſcruple of having Alliance with thoſe Infidels, becauſe ſome of their Divines have maintain'd, that they might be made uſe of as of Horſes and Elephants. <hi>Gibraltar</hi> gives its Name to the famous Streight, which communicates the Ocean and <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean-Seas,</hi>

And the Duke, ſhortly after, went with a parcel of Musketeers, and ſubdued them eaſily, they having no offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Weapons but only Slings.

                     <hi>POrtugal</hi> is a Kingdom, ancient for above five hundred years in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> where was formerly <hi>Luſitania.</hi> In all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this Name of <hi>Portugal</hi> came from that of <hi>Porto,</hi> a Town conſiderable for its Commerce, and from that of <hi>Cale</hi> a ſmall Place near it. It is, from the South to the North, about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Leagues in length; in breadth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:153186:130"/>five and twenty, thirty, and ſometimes fifty. Its Situation upon the Ocean, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its Inhabitants in point of Navigation, has given occaſion to them to make Conqueſts in the four parts of the World, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> Their Conqueſts have been in above five thouſand Leagues of Coaſt, in <hi>Braſil,</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> All their Places were near the Sea, for they had no other deſign than that of rendring themſelves Maſters of Commerce. True it is, that, during the War, they were oblig'd to ſuſtain againſt <hi>Spain</hi> for eight and twenty years together, and by reaſon of the great Garriſons they were oblig'd to keep, in thoſe parts againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom they have nevertheleſs drove entirely out of <hi>Braſil,</hi> they made but ſmall profit, and this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to give ſome places to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> Provinces have all their peculiar Commodities: they afford, among other things, Lemons, and excellent Oranges. They have Mines; the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> went to ſeek in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Gold which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> go to ſeek in the <hi>Indies.</hi> They are ſo populous, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally towards the Sea, as that there are reckoned above ſix hundred Cities, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Burroughs, and above four thouſand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. The <hi>Roman Catholick Religion</hi> is only receiv'd in this Kingdom; thoſe, who are of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Race, have been conſtrained to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and are now known under the Name of <hi>New Chriſtians.</hi> There are three Arch-biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, <hi>Lisbon, Braga,</hi> and <hi>Evora;</hi> ten Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. The Arch-biſhopricks of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and

                     <hi>Evora,</hi> have each of 'em full two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers yearly Income. Inquiſitions are at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> at <hi>Coimbre,</hi> at <hi>Evora;</hi> the Aſſembly of the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Parliaments, at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> at <hi>Porto.</hi> Twenty ſeven Places have Generalities, which they call <hi>Comarques,</hi> and <hi>Almoxarifats.</hi> The Order of <hi>Christ,</hi> which reſides at <hi>Tomar,</hi> is the moſt conſiderable of the Kingdom: the Kings are the Maſters and Heads of it; for on this Order depend all the Foreign Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: Its Knights wear the Red and White Croſs in the Middle, whereas thoſe of <hi>Avis</hi> wear it green, thoſe of St. <hi>James</hi> red. Theſe have their Reſidence at <hi>Palmella,</hi> near <hi>Setuval.</hi> The Revenue of the Kingdom, without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the <hi>Indies,</hi> is ſaid to exceed ten Millions of Livers: I can hardly believe what the <hi>Portugals</hi> ſay, that their King, <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> was at the Charge of a Million of Gold upon the Harneſs of a Horſe; that the Trappings of the <hi>European</hi> Ladies, were only the remains of thoſe of <hi>Portugal.</hi> In the Year 1640. this Kingdom withdrew it ſelf from its Obedience to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Then was admired the Great Secreſie that was kept in that Affair, among above two hundred perſons, for above a Year together. The principal Motives of this Reſolution, were, the Permiſſion which his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty</hi> gave to others, than to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> of trading to the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of the fifth, that was proclaim'd in the Year 1636. by which the Government exacted five in the hundred, of all the Revenues and Merchandizes in the Kingdom. The Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was proclaimed King, under the Name of <hi>John</hi> the Fourth. This Prince reigned
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:153186:131"/>ſixteen Years, and had for his Succeſſour, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> the Sixth; who was depoſed in 1667. His Marriage having been declared null, <hi>Pedro,</hi> his Brother, married the Queen, was made Regent of the Kingdom, and made Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> The Conſpiracy, in the Year 1673. againſt this Prince, obliged him to have the King fetch'd back from the <hi>Terzera,</hi> and put into the Fortreſs of <hi>Sintra,</hi> near <hi>Lisbon:</hi> About two Years ſince, a Marriage was concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and <hi>Victor Ame,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but that Match is now wholly broke off, and a new Treaty now on foot, for the ſame purpoſe, with the Prince of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> This Kingdom contains ſix Provinces, which are as many general Governments. <hi>Entre Doaro</hi> and <hi>Minho, Tralos-Montes, Beyra, Eſtremadura, Alen-Teyo</hi> and <hi>Algarve. Entre Douro</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> is the moſt delicious, and ſo populous, that in the ſpace of eighteen Leagues in length, and twelve in breadth, it has above a hundred and thirty Monaſteries, well rented; fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixteen Pariſhes; five thouſand Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Spring-Water; two hundred Bridges of Stone, and ſix Sea-Ports. Some call it the Marrow and the Delight of <hi>Spain.

Tralos-Montes</hi> has Minerals, with the City of <hi>Braganza,</hi> the Capital of a Dutchy of forty thouſand Ducates Revenue, wherein there are full fifty ſmall Cities, and other Lands, which make the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> thrice Marquis, ſeven times a Count, and ſeveral
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:153186:131"/>times a Lord. The Princes of that Name, now in poſſeſſion of the Crown, remain'd commonly at <hi>Villa Vicioſa,</hi> and had the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, to the Excluſion of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſit in publick, under the Royal Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the King of <hi>Spain.

Its City of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> formerly the abode of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> is famous for its Univerſity, for its Biſhoprick, which is ſaid to be worth above a hundred and fifty thouſand Livres yearly Rent. <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> another than that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> produces Wine, Oyl, Salt, Honey, which the Bees make there of the Flowers of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and of Roſes. Its City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> is the Capital of all the Kingdom, one of the richeſt, greateſt, moſt beautiful, and moſt populous Towns of all <hi>Europe:</hi> It has above thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Houſes, and an admirable Port, with the conveniency of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea: It particularly drives the trade of <hi>Braſile,</hi> and of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> The ſmall City of <hi>Belem,</hi> which is near it, is the <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> or the place of burial of ſeveral Kings of <hi>Portugal. Santaren</hi> has ſo great a number of Olive-Trees in its Dependencies, that the Inhabitants boaſt of being able to make of their Oyl, a River as great as the <hi>Tagus. Setuval,</hi> which the <hi>Flemmings</hi> call St. <hi>Hubes,</hi> is well ſituated, well built, and of great trade: It has the beſt Harbour in all the Kingdom, thirty Miles in length, three in breadth. Its Salt-Pits and Fiſhery, according to what the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſay, raiſe a greater Revenue to their King, than all <hi>Arragon</hi> does to the King of <hi>Spain.

The Name of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> is given them, as a Country ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the lower part of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> is ſo much the more conſiderable, as that it lies between <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> Theſe Seventeen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces touch <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from <hi>England</hi> by the Sea.

                  <p>This Region is ſmall, but one of the richeſt and moſt populous in the World. Its Air is temperate; its Winter is more long than cold; its Summer reſembles the Spring of the Southern Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> Its Soyl is generally fertile, full of good Paſturages, which furniſh Cattel, Milk, Butter, Cheeſe, and other Commodities abundantly. Its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Rivers are the <hi>Rhine, Maes, Scheld.</hi> The <hi>Rhine</hi> has its Sources in <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> moſt of its Courſe in <hi>Germany:</hi> after having divided it ſelf upon its entrance into the low Countrys at <hi>Skinckenſckons,</hi> it communicates moſt of its Waters to other Rivers; thoſe it keeps, loſe their Name in the Sand, a little below <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>Maes,</hi> which comes from <hi>France</hi> and from <hi>Lorrain,</hi> has this advantage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that it carries its Name and Waters to the very Ocean, wherein it forms ſeveral good Harbours. The <hi>Scheld</hi> ſerv'd for bounds to <hi>France,</hi> and to the Empire, in the time of the Emperour <hi>Charles the Bold.</hi> It receives, at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the <hi>Lis,</hi> or <hi>Ley,</hi> a navigable River: and before it entirely loſes its Name, it makes two principal Branches, the left, called <hi>Hont;</hi> the right, whoſe Chanel paſſes by <hi>Tolen,</hi> falls into the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> Beſides theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and thoſe which fall into them, there are Canals; great ſtore of Lakes, Pools, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:153186:133"/>Marſhes, which fortifie the Country, provide it with Fiſh, and afford the convenience of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and the more eaſie tranſport of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>

We may ſay, that the two <hi>Real</hi> Cauſes of this Revolution, were, the Change of Religion, and the Ambition of ſome Lords, joyn'd to the Averſion of the People, to a foreign Government. Two Years before, theſe Revolted Provinces had made the Union at <hi>

There are in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> two States, very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from one another; the one is a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or rather ſeveral Republicks, and is called for that reaſon the <hi>

The National Synod, held at <hi>Dort,</hi> in the Year 1619. has regulated the principal Points of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>The Humours of the People of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> are as different from one another, as are their Governments and Religions: The <hi>Flemmings</hi> do much affect thoſe fine Titles of Honour, which the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have not been ſparing of to them. The Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, had a deſign of making a Kingdom of this State, ſo as would have done before him <hi>Charles the Bold,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> who meant to have it called, <hi>the Kingdom of the Lyon.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are more popular than the <hi>Flemmings;</hi> wedded to Commerce, to Manufacture, and Navigation: Both People are induſtrious in making Handy-craft-Works. They have two ſorts of Tongues; the <hi>Walloon,</hi> which is a corrupted <hi>French,</hi> and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes purer, ſince the <hi>French</hi> King's Conqueſts; and the <hi>Flemming,</hi> or <hi>Low Dutch:</hi> The firſt is particularly in <hi>Artois,</hi> in <hi>French-Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Haynault.</hi>

The Seal of the Republick, is a Lion, holding a Bundle of Seven bound Arrows, with alluſion to as many

There is no State in the World of ſo ſmall an Extent, which has ſo great a number of Fortreſſes, and which ſeems better defended by the Nature of the Places than this: It has the See, and ſeveral Rivers, which defend it; the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Waal,</hi> the <hi>Iſſel.</hi> Notwithſtanding all theſe Defences, the <hi>French</hi> King made ſurpriſing Conqueſts in the Year 1672. by the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of three Provinces, and ſixty conſiderable Towns, which proceeded from raw, unexpert, meer Citizens ſons, being imploid in the Soldiery.</p>

Each Province may ſend thither one, two, three, four or five Deputies; but all theſe Deputies have, together, but one Voice, and have right to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide therein but one Week: That of <hi>Guelder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> begins, becauſe it is the moſt Ancient, and its Plenipotentiaries were the firſt who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Union. It is the ſame Province, which, in the Year 1674. had offer'd the Sovereignty to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Admiralty has five Seſſions, and as many Magazines, which are thoſe of <hi>Rotterdam, Amſterdam, Horn</hi> or <hi>Enkuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, Middlebourg, Harlingen;</hi> the three former in <hi>Holland,</hi> the fourth in <hi>Zealand,</hi> the fifth in <hi>Frieſland.</hi> As touching Religion, all ſorts of

                  <p>The Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> taken by it ſelf, is a great <hi>Peninſula,</hi> which maintains it ſelf againſt the Aſſaults of the Sea by the means of its Dikes, where a careful Watch is kept both Day and Night.

In the Year 1421. of a Town upon the Continent, it became an Iſland by a terrible Inundation, which drown'd above ten thouſand Perſons and twelve Villages. <hi>Haerlem</hi> is the Place where the fineſt and whiteſt Linnen is made of the Province. <hi>Delf</hi> is the Place of the Sepulchre of the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> and where <hi>Porcelain</hi> Ware is made. <hi>Leyden</hi> is the Eye, or, according to others, the Garden of <hi>Holland,</hi> by reaſon of the Cleanneſs of its Streets, and the Beauty of

In the Battel of <hi>Morat,</hi> in the Year 1476. which followed that of <hi>Granſon,</hi> and preceded that of <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Diamond of this warlike and unfortunate Prince, fell into the hands of a <hi>Suiſs,</hi> who thought himſelf well payed, in having for it a <hi>Florin</hi> of Gold, tho' this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond was one of the fineſt things of the kind in <hi>Europe.</hi> Another <hi>Suiſs</hi> was ſo lucky in the ſame Battel, as to find the Collar of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> of an ineſtimable value, which the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was wont to wear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with two Crowns, that were given him for it in <hi>Milan,</hi> whither he went to ſell it at the deareſt rate he could.

This Diſgrace ſtuck ſo ſenſibly cloſe to that glorious Prince's heart, that there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently after the inſult he receiv'd from Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxony;</hi> it's ſaid to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to reſign his Dominions to his Son and his Brother, and make the retreat he did in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Just,</hi> in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> to the amazement of the whole World.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> have hitherto ſtyled themſelves Princes of the Empire, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire has pretended Right of Sovereignty over their Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Nevertheleſs, they pretend to be exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Imperial Chamber of <hi>Spire,</hi> and from all the Contributions by the Empire. They have neglected to aſſiſt at the Dyets of the Empire, that ſo they might not be bound to give place to ſuch Princes, as they eſteemed leſs than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Dutchy of <hi>Barr</hi> is a Fief depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and chiefly what is on this ſide the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> as for what is beyond it, he pretends its dependence on him, under the Title of Marquiſate of <hi>Pont,</hi> or <hi>Ponta-Mouſſon.</hi> From whence it comes, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>Barrois</hi> are eſteemed Natural <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:153186:144"/>Anthony, Francis, Charles</hi> the Third, Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did Homage for it to the <hi>French</hi> Kings.

                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:153186:146"/>as being beyond <hi>Mount-Jura.</hi> The <hi>Rhine, Rhoſne, Aar, Ruſs, Inn, Teſin,</hi> and other Rivers, have their Sources in <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> for which reaſon this Country is eſteemed the higheſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Teſin</hi> and <hi>Ruſs</hi> furniſh them with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Trading into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Several Lakes there are, the moſt conſiderable of which, are thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Conſtance.</hi> All theſe Waters produce Fiſh in abundance, and the Mountains in this Tract afford the means of Hunting Bucks, Shamoies, or Wild-Goats and Boors. The <hi>Switzers</hi> are well ſhap'd and proportioned, and very ſtrong and robuſt for the moſt part. Their beſt Revenue comes from the Penſions they receive from the <hi>French</hi> King, and the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Their Cattel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them Butter, Cheeſe and Milk: Their Intereſt is to maintain Peace, and to remain united among themſelves. They ſpeak both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> in this Country, but have corrupted ſeveral terms of both Tongues. 'Tis held, that, upon occaſion, they are able to bring into the Field ſixty thouſand fighting Men; the Canton of <hi>Bearn</hi> alone being capable of raiſing eighteen thouſand. It is an Infantry which renders good ſervice to the Prince who imploys it, as numerous as it was in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> It ſeems to pawn its own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by engaging it ſelf under the pay of others; but by ſo doing, it preſerves the freedom of its Country. The Valour and Fidelity of the <hi>Switzers</hi> have invited the <hi>French</hi> Kings, the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to conſide in them for the Guard of their proper Perſons, and the greateſt Families of <hi>Europe</hi> do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain their Alliance. True it is, they have not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:153186:146"/>ſo many Nobles as formerly; but thoſe they have are very conſiderable, and a miſtake it is to believe that they were wholly extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                  <p>Under the Name of <hi>Suiſſerland</hi> are known thirteen Cantons of the Country, which are ſubject to them, and of their Allies. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, as well as the Allies, are as many Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks govern'd by their Magiſtrates, whom they call <hi>Burgher-Maſters,</hi> or <hi>Avoyers,</hi> or <hi>Landames.</hi> This Name is given to the chief of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, where are no Cities. The Cantons and the Allies have Ordinances independent on one another; nevertheleſs they Govern ſometimes ſeveral Provinces together, and they have Laws almoſt a-like with a ſtrict Union, they have often given them the Name of the Republick of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or of the Lords of the Leagues. In this Commonwealth are two ſorts of Religion the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Roman-Catholick.</hi> When menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cantons, they reckon either five or ſeven of them: The five are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri, Switz, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndervald, Lucerne, Zug:</hi> The two others, <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Soleurre. Zurich, Bern, Baſle, Schafouſe</hi> are Proteſtants: <hi>Glaris</hi> and <hi>Appenzel</hi> have both Papiſts and Proteſtants. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Religion does often cauſe their affairs to be embroil'd, and ſometimes occaſions their Aſſembling ſeparately. Commonly the five Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cantons hold their Aſſembly at <hi>Lucerne,</hi> the four Proteſtant Cities at <hi>Aran.</hi> The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſemblies are held every Year at <hi>Baden,</hi> ſo called from its Baths. Each Canton is free to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:153186:147"/>engage it ſelf with whom it thinks convenient, ſo that the <hi>Switzers</hi> are found in different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nevertheleſs the <hi>Switzers</hi> ſharing in almoſt all the Wars that are made in <hi>Europe,</hi> have none themſelves, and live in Peace in their own Country. As concerning ſuccours, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons have certain Treaties, they can call and ſummon one another: Some have no right but of calling three or five, but thoſe who ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuccours, may alſo cauſe others to come, who are allied to them; thus moſt commonly they all joyn therein, each according to its Forces. They have not all an equal Authority over their ſubject Countries, they have it only according to the Aſſociations which they have made in divers times: And thoſe who entred laſt into the Leagues have not any Right over the Countries, which have been ſubjected before the times of their Leagues. Amongſt all theſe Cantons, <hi>Zurich</hi> has the Preſidence: <hi>Bern</hi> is the moſt powerful; <hi>Baſle</hi> has the fineſt City, the abode and the Rendezvous of ſeveral Learned Men: The Canton of <hi>Schafouſe,</hi> has its City of great Trade: <hi>Soleurre</hi> has one too of the ſame Name, where Reſides the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri, Swits, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwald, Glaris, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penzel</hi> have only Burroughs.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Countries, ſubjected to the Cantons, have either been Conquered by Arms, or ſubmitted voluntarily. There is about a ſcore of them, which, for the moſt part, have the Title of Bailywicks, as <hi>Baden</hi> and thoſe which lie in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>Among the Allies of the Cantons, the <hi>Griſons</hi> are the moſt powerful. They are ſo called from one of their Ligues, whoſe Inhabitants were uſed to wear Grey Scarfes.

                  <p>Their way, of reckoning the Hours, is very different from ours; they regulating it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sun's ſetting; then they count four and twenty Hours; and at the entrance of the Night, they begin to reckon the Hours
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:153186:149"/>of a New Day: Inſomuch that the number of the Hours at Noon riſes and falls, according to the Seaſons, tho' there are always four and twenty Hours for the <hi>Civil Day,</hi> that is, for the Day and Night together. For Example: On the twelfth day of <hi>August</hi> at Noon, which we reckon twelve a Clock, the <hi>Italians</hi> reckon ſeventeen; and ſo what remains, to finiſh the <hi>Civil Day</hi> of four and twenty Hours, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſeven Hours, which make up juſt the time which the Sun employs that day, the twelfth of <hi>August,</hi> ſince the Hour of Noon unto its ſetting.</p>
                  <p>The Sovereign Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> are the <hi>Pope,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who poſſeſs almoſt half of it, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Lucca.</hi> The other Princes are call'd <hi>Petty,</hi> by reaſon of the ſmall extent of their Dominions. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> is independent; moſt of the other States depend either on the Church, or the Empire, for ſome Fiefs. The Quality of Duke is in <hi>Italy</hi> more conſiderable than of Prince, bating in the Territories of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> There are ſo many Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks and Biſhopricks, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> alone has more than all <hi>France</hi> hath; the truth is, moſt of 'em have not ſo good a Revenue, as our Country Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Italy</hi> is divided into three great parts; the High, which may be called <hi>Lombardy;</hi> the Middle, and the Low: According to this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is found in the High, <hi>Piemont, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:153186:150"/>Milantz,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>Genoa, Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, Modenois, Mantouan,</hi> the Domain of <hi>Venice, Trentin:</hi> The State of the Church, <hi>Tuſcany, Lucquois,</hi> are in the Middle; the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> poſſeſſes the reſt. There is a fourth part, if we may add the Iſles thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piemont,</hi> according to the ſaying of a <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montin,</hi> is a City of three hundred Miles in compaſs: One and the ſame Land produces Corn, Wine, and Fruits. <hi>Turin,</hi> the abode of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> is a lovely Town, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſtrong Cittadel. It keeps in its Metropolitan Church, call'd the <hi>Dome,</hi> the Relick of St. <hi>Suaire,</hi> wherein the Face of our Lord is imprinted, with moſt of his Body; It boaſts of having, of all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> brought the Preſs into uſe. <hi>Nice,</hi> near the Sea, has ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, and a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, which ſeems inacceſſible by reaſon of its ſituation upon a Rock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montferrat</hi> has moſt of its Towns upon Hills, very fertile in Corn and Wine. By the Peace of <hi>Quieras,</hi> a part of that Country was yielded to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining the Duke of <hi>Mantua's,</hi> who poſſeſſes <hi>Caſal,</hi> near the <hi>Po.</hi> This Town is fortified with ſeveral Bulwarks and Half-moons, with a Caſtle and a ſtrong Cittadel, compoſed of ſix great Baſtions.</p>
                  <p>The Land of <hi>Milan</hi> is the moſt beautiful Country of all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and the fineſt Dutchy of Chriſtendom, now poſſeſs'd by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Ways are pleaſant, almoſt all in a direct line, with Chanels of Spring-Water on both ſides, and rows and plantations of Trees,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:153186:150"/>which make them reſemble Alleys and Walks. The Champain of <hi>Milan</hi> is ſo fertile, that there is not an Inch of Land, but brings forth twice a Year. The Nobility, as well as in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> does not meddle with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as does that of the other neighbouring States. The City of <hi>Milan</hi> is called Great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is full ten Miles in compaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it contains above two hundred and thirty Churches, ninety ſix Pariſhes, as many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and above a hundred Fraternities. It is a general Mart of the Merchandizes of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo great a number of <hi>Artizans</hi> it has of all ſorts, that the <hi>Italians</hi> have it for a Proverb, <hi>That</hi> Milan <hi>muſt be ruin'd, if they would accommodate</hi> Italy <hi>with them.</hi> It has ever paſſed for a ſecond <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' it has been beſieged forty times, and taken two and twenty: Its ſtrength conſiſts rather in its Men, than in its Walls, it being reckoned to contain above three hundred thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Its Caſtle is one of the fineſt Fortreſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> of ſix great Baſtions Royal, inveſted with Brick, with Grafts and Ditches full of running Water.</p>
                  <p>The Coaſt of <hi>Genoa,</hi> formerly called <hi>Liguria,</hi> produces Muſcate-Wines, Olives in abundance, all manner of good Fruits; the Weſtern part particularly is full of Lemmon, Orange, Fig, Palm, and Cedar-trees: the Inland of the Country is mountainous, full of Woods, which furniſh Materials for the making of Ships and Galleys. The Situation of <hi>Genoa</hi> is upon the Sea-ſhore, part in Plains, part in Hills. The City is full five Miles round, and has Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are yet much greater in circuit;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:153186:151"/>for which reaſon, it is the greateſt, the moſt trading, and the moſt important of all <hi>Italy,</hi> towards the Weſt. The Buildings and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of this Town are ſo magnificent and ſo beautiful, that it is called <hi>the Stately,</hi> tho' very much endamag'd by the late Batteries of the <hi>French.</hi> One of the principal Revenues of its Inhabitants conſiſts in the tranſportation of Silk-ſtuffs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parma,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Parmezan,</hi> is the common abode of the Duke of that Name, of the Houſe of the <hi>Farnezes,</hi> a Feudatory of the Church. It has a Cittadel, whereon Money has not been ſparing, for the rendring it good and a fair Palace for its Princes dwelling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Modena</hi> is the Capital of the Dutchy of the ſame Name, fortified with Bulwarks, after the ancient manner, inhabited by above thirty five thouſand Souls. In <hi>Modena</hi> it was, that <hi>Brutus</hi> was in vain beſieged by <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> after the Murder of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Octavius</hi> having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily defeated the Army of him, who would by this Siege have renewed the Civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mantua</hi> is ſeated in the Waters of a Lake of twenty Miles in circuit, which only affords en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance by Cauſeys into the Town. Its Mills do raiſe a good Revenue to this Duke; the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are there very numerous, pay him a great Tribute. The Ducal Palace is one of the fineſt and beſt furniſh'd in all <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Demeſn of <hi>Venice</hi> has ſo many Rivers, Canals, and Navigable Lakes, that Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes are eaſily conveyed into all its places. The Republick is independent, above twelve hundred Years ſtanding, the Bulwark of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> The City of <hi>Venice</hi> is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:153186:151"/>one of the greateſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo populous, that there are reckoned above three hundred thouſand perſons. Thoſe who have ſeen it, may boaſt of having ſeen one of the Wonders of the World. Its <hi>Arcenal</hi> is the fineſt, the greateſt, and the beſt furniſhed upon Earth. The Iſles, whereof the City is compoſed, are ſeparated from one another by Chanels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there be above fifteen thouſand Boats, which they call <hi>Gondoles.</hi> The Church and Palace of St. <hi>Mark</hi> are very fine Structures; the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of St. <hi>Mark</hi> contains immenſe Riches.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhoprick of <hi>Trent,</hi> which belongs to its Biſhop, is under the Protection of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The City of <hi>Trent</hi> is ancient, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited both by <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for-holding the laſt General Council.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the Church is look'd upon as ſo much the more conſiderable, in that the Pope, who is the Temporal and Spiritual Prince of it, pretends to be the Chief and Soveraign Pontife of all Chriſtendom, the Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Weſt; Primate and Exarch of <hi>Italy,</hi> Metropolitan of the Suffragan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>John de Lateran. Rome,</hi> formerly the Capital of the fineſt, greateſt, and moſt conſiderable Empire of the Univerſe, was once the Miſtreſs of the better part of the World, famous for excellent Men, who have ſurpaſſed others in Valour, in Piety, in Juſtice and Temperance. It has had in its beginning Kings, Conſuls and Emperours: the <hi>Papiſts</hi> call it <hi>Rome the Holy,</hi> by reaſon of the Reſidence of the Popes. We may ſay, it has few Equals, if we conſider its Antiquities, Churches, Palaces, and Curioſities.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:153186:152"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuſcany</hi> has three principal Cities, <hi>Florence; Siena, Piſa,</hi> formerly as many Republicks. <hi>Florence,</hi> the Capital of this State, renowned upon the account of its Beauty, is large and very populous. The Palace of the <hi>Great Duke</hi> has fine Pictures, Jewels of great value, ſeveral Rarities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucca,</hi> fortified with eleven regular Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, is famous for its Silks and Olives. The Head of this Republick is a <hi>Gonfalonier,</hi> or Chief-Standard-Bearer, whoſe Charge laſts but two Months.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is the greateſt State of <hi>Italy,</hi> it belongs to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who pays for it, every Year, a white Hobbey to the Pope, with ſeven thouſand Ducats. The Spring is there ſo long, and ſo full of Flowers, the Autumn ſo loaded with Fruits, that it is eſteemed a Paradiſe. The City of <hi>Naples</hi> is the abode of ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which makes it be called the <hi>Gentile.</hi> It is ſituated ſo advantagiouſly, that it ſeems an abridgment of all the Beauties of <hi>Italy.</hi> There are few Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> who have ſo many Churches, and ſo many Cittadels, as has <hi>Naples.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>GErmany</hi> has very fertile Provinces, and a great number of fine Cities. The Corn, Fruits, Salt, and other Commodities, afford a very conſiderable Revenue. It is now an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Empire, wherein is a vaſt number of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign States, of which the Emperour is the chief. The Laws of this Empire do allow of three Religions, the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> and Evangelical, and the <hi>Calvinist</hi> or Reformed. Nevertheleſs, there be ſeveral other Sects, tho' the <hi>Germans</hi> do almoſt all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the belief of their Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> has this advantage, that it is in the midſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſerves for the Seat of the Empire: the Emperor governs it by the means of Diets, which are much like Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The principal Articles of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are contained in the Golden Bull, which treats of the Election of the King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> of the Duty of Electors, of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, of the Authority of the Emperor, of the means of preſerving the Repoſe and Peace in the Empire. This Bull is a ſmall Book, whoſe Original, written in Parchment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains four and twenty Leaves, and thirty Chapters. It has a great round Seal of pure Gold, faſten'd to ſtrings of yellow and red Silk. It has on the one ſide the Portrait of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, on the other a Caſtle with two Towers, with theſe Words, <hi>Aurea Roma.</hi> The Election of the Emperor ought to be made
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:153186:153"/>at <hi>Francfort</hi> upon the <hi>Mein,</hi> but this was not obſerved in the late Elections. Beſides the Aſſemblies which concern the Affairs of the Empire in general, there be three ſorts of 'em, thoſe of the Electors for the chuſing of the Emperor; thoſe of the Deputies, whereto the Emperor ſends his Commiſſioner; thoſe of the Circles, like to the Aſſemblies of the States of our great Provinces. There be ten Circles in the Empire, thoſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of <hi>Suabia,</hi> of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> or of the <hi>High Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Electoral,</hi> or of the <hi>Low Rhine,</hi> of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> of <hi>High Saxony,</hi> of <hi>Low Saxony,</hi> of <hi>Franconia,</hi> of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> this laſt is no longer Convened. Each Circle has an Eccleſiaſtick and a Secular Director, who preſide together in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: two or three Circles may aſſemble, when one of 'em is attacked from abroad, or diſturbed with inteſtine troubles.</p>
                  <p>The Empire is much the ſame with that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' it does not comprehend ſo great an extent of Land: the Princes or States, whereof it is compoſed, are of five forts, the <hi>Emperor,</hi> now of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the <hi>Electors,</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Princes,</hi> the <hi>Secular Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Free Towns.</hi> In the General Dyets, there be three Bodies, that of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> that of the <hi>Princes,</hi> that of the <hi>Imperial Cities.</hi> There are reckoned to be above three hundred Sovereignties in <hi>Germany,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Emperor no farther than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and in Reſort.</p>
                  <p>The Dominions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> be of three ſorts, thoſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> which are Hereditary to it; thoſe of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where it has the ſame Right; thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which it
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:153186:153"/>has by Election. The Emperor does common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain either his Son, or his Brother, or his neareſt Relation, to be choſen King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in his Life-time; afterwards has him Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and, if he finds any diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, has him Elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that is to ſay, his perpetual Vicar and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Succeſſor to the Empire. Without the Revenue of his Hereditary Countries, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would not have wherewith to maintain a very conſiderable Train; he does not poſſeſs any Land under the Title of Imperial Majeſty. His Principal Rights are the Erection and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture of Fiefs, the granting of Priviledges, the Right of Legitimation: He may make Laws, give Safe-Guards, eſtabliſh Poſts, make Parliaments, compoſe Univerſities, erect Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs into Cities, create Offices, puts Towns into the Ban of the Empire: In ſhort, he may make Kings, Dukes, Marqueſſes, and has the Superiority over all the Princes of the Empire, who, upon this account, pay him a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p>The Electors are to the number of eight, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Treves,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> the Prince <hi>Palatine.</hi> Theſe Electors Chuſe and Crown the Emperor; the Pope confirms this Election and Coronation. Four Voices are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to raiſe any one to the Imperial Dignity, and at preſent the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> has only his Seſſion in the Election. The Secular Electors may nominate themſelves: The Lands or their Electorates cannot be diſmembred: In the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:153186:154"/>Houſe of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Electorate is for the eldeſt alone, who ſhares the other Seigniories with his Brothers. The Elector of <hi>Brandenboug</hi> is the moſt Potent, and poſſeſſes the moſt Land of all thoſe Princes; his States are above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>German</hi> Leagues in length, for the moſt part ſeparated from one another, yet a Courier may go from one end to another, and always lye upon this Electors Land.</p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtick Princes are of ſeveral ſorts, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Salzbourg,</hi> the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, ſeveral Biſhops and other great Prelates; Abbots, Abbeſſes, who have no Voice but in Body. Theſe Princes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all abſolute over the Temporality of their Benefices, and <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> has no Prelates ſo Potent as they are. The Election of moſt of their Dignities belongs to the Chapters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes or Emperors being to concern themſelves therein. As <hi>Germany</hi> is divided for Religion, there remain ſome <hi>Lutheran</hi> Biſhops, who have the Title of Biſhops, until that they have Contracted Marriage; and when they are Married, they are called Adminiſtrators.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſecular Princes, are the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Princes of the Electoral Houſes, ſome Dukes, Marqueſſes and Land-Graves. There be alſo Counts and Barons, who differ little but in Name, and who have immediate Dependency on the Empire. They have Seſſion in Body, which has four Voices in the States of the Empire; they have each their own in their particular Aſſemblies; ſeveral amongſt them Coin Monies. Nobles there be in <hi>Suevia</hi> or <hi>Schwaben</hi> in <hi>Franconia,</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who are abſolute over their Lands, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:153186:154"/>Lords of the Empire are over theirs. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principalities of <hi>Germany</hi> are often poſſeſs'd by one ſole Prince; and ſometimes one Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality alone belongs there to ſeveral. The youngeſt Brothers have almoſt the ſame Titles with the eldeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Free Towns, which are as many ſmall Republicks, be principally of two ſorts, <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> and <hi>Anſeatick.</hi> The <hi>Imperial</hi> have the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Empire in their Arms, either whole or divided; have Right to ſend to the Diet, where their Body has two Voices, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered upon the Bank of <hi>Suevia</hi> and upon the Bank of the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Thus are they divided, by reaſon of the Benches where the Deputies of thoſe Cities have their Seats: The Deputy of the City of <hi>Cologne</hi> holds the firſt Rank of the Bench of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> has the firſt place of that of <hi>Suevia.</hi> Some have Noble Families, by which they are Governed, others have a Popular Government.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> are Confederated together for the mutually ſuccouring one another, upon occaſion, againſt their Enemies, for maintaining the Liberty of the Commerce, for the not being burthened with any Impoſitions by Foreign Princes; the conſideration of this League is now of little uſe to ſeveral of thoſe Towns, each of them endeavouring to do its own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by it ſelf. They were reckoned to be ſixty ſix. <hi>Lubeck, Cologne, Brunſwick, Dantzick</hi> are the Capitals of them, with as many Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. <hi>Lubeck</hi> may Convene all the reſt, with the advice of five of thoſe Towns, which are neareſt it.</p>

                  <p>The moſt renowned Rivers of <hi>Germany,</hi> are the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Elbe,</hi> the <hi>Oder,</hi> the <hi>Weſer:</hi> The <hi>Rhine,</hi> the greateſt of Rivers which goes towards the Ocean, has its Source in <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> and its end in <hi>Holland,</hi> where it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its Name in the Sand: It is ſo broad below <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> that Bridges cannot be made over it. There is not one in the World, that Waters ſo many Sovereign States. The fineſt Cities, by which it paſſes, are on this ſide its Bed or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, moſt of 'em built by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made it the bound of their Empire. It former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated <hi>Gaul</hi> from <hi>Germany;</hi> during the firſt Race of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, it paſſed through ſome part of their Territories. The <hi>Danube,</hi> which begins in <hi>Suevia,</hi> has a Courſe of above ſeven hundred Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The moſt eaſie Diviſion of <hi>Germany</hi> is, that which has made it into two parts, the one <hi>High,</hi> and the other <hi>Low,</hi> according to the Courſe of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and of the <hi>Oder.</hi> Each of thoſe parts has ſeveral Provinces: The <hi>High</hi> has four towards the Weſt, <hi>Alſatia,</hi> the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate of the <hi>Rhine, Franconia, Suevia:</hi> And four great States towards the Eaſt, <hi>Tirol, Bavaria,</hi> which is of two ſorts, Dutchy and Palatinate; <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which alſo comprehends <hi>Sileſia</hi> with <hi>Moravia;</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which has other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Lands, namely, <hi>Carinthia, Carniola</hi> and <hi>Stiria.

It has its particular States, its Cuſtoms and its Tongue, different from thoſe of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, tho' its King be one of the Electors of the Empire. The Inheritance of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom has been confirmed to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by the Peace of <hi>Munſter. Prague,</hi> the Capital, is compoſed of three Cities, and ſo populous, that under the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, there are ſaid to have gone from thence above forty thouſand Foreign Scholars, for that their Priviledges were retrenched: The great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in the Year 1620. which was fought near its Walls, decided, in leſs than an Hours time, the Quarrels of the Kingdom, in favour of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, againſt <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Elector Palatine. <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the only Arch-Dutchy in the World, is not ſubject to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Empire, and does not Contribute to its neceſſity.

The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> commands Countries of vaſt extent, which for the moſt part are cold, by reaſon of their Situation towards the North, full of Mountains and Woods, and Ice and Snow. Of this Number are the Kingdom of <hi>Norway, Greenland,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Iſland</hi> and of <hi>Fero.</hi> Towards the North of <hi>America,</hi> there be ſome Lands which bear the Name of <hi>New-Denmark:</hi> Some Fortreſſes in <hi>Guinea, Kranke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> in <hi>Coromandel,</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſubjection to his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark.</hi> What is particularly comprehended under the Name of <hi>Denmark,</hi> is the beſt inhabited, the fineſt and the moſt fertile.

The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſtyles himſelf Count of <hi>Oldembourg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt,</hi> as the Eighth King of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, into which the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> came in the Year 1448. by the Election of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I. He is now in poſſeſſion of it, and cauſed to be built there, in the Year 1681. a new City, with a Sea-Port, under the Name of <hi>Chriſtiana.</hi> The Opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> is followed in <hi>Denmark</hi> ſince the Reign of King <hi>Frederiek,</hi> Elected in the Year 1523. There is no great Trade drove
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:153186:157"/>in <hi>Denmark,</hi> but there is a fine Revenue ariſing from the Cuſtoms which the Merchandizes pay, that paſs through the Streight of the <hi>Sound,</hi> the Key of the <hi>Baltick-Sea.</hi> This Streight is a Mile in breadth, and the Courſe which the Ships there ſteer, with the moſt ſafety and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, is nearer <hi>Cronembourg,</hi> than <hi>Elſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> which belongs to the Crown of <hi>Sueden.</hi> This Revenue is no longer ſo conſiderable, ſince the <hi>Suedes</hi> do not pay there now what they did formerly: and it would be leſs, if the deſign was brought about, that has been entertain'd, of joyning the <hi>Baltick Sea</hi> to the <hi>Elve,</hi> by the Lake of <hi>Swerin,</hi> if the tranſportation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities be continued by Land from <hi>Hambourg</hi> to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and if the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> brings to perfection the Chanel, which he has begun at <hi>Mulras,</hi> for the tranſporting the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> from the <hi>Oder</hi> into the <hi>Elve.</hi> Ships of ordinary Bulk, which take their way through the Streight of the <hi>Belt,</hi> caſt Anchor before <hi>Nibourg,</hi> and there pay the Impoſt. This Streight is broader, but not ſo deep as that of the <hi>Sound,</hi> by which means the Sea is there very rough: the great Ships meet with ſeveral Iſlands there, and do not willingly ſteer their Courſe that way, which they take more directly and more conveniently through the <hi>Sound.</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> raiſes alſo a great Revenue from the Cattel of his Dominions, which afford 'em both very fat and in great plenty. The <hi>Germans</hi> carry away from thence every Year above fifty thouſand Oxen into their own Country; Other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners go into <hi>Denmark</hi> to buy Horſes. Such abundance is there of Deer, that three or four
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:153186:158"/>hundred are ſometimes killed, in one Chace alone; the <hi>Danes</hi> are us'd to ſalt and barrel 'em up, for the victualling, as they ſay, the King's Ships: the hunting of thoſe Creatures is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perform'd in Chariots, or a ſort of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Waggons, by reaſon theſe Machines do not fright away the Deer.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:153186:158"/>was an Action as bold as that never the like was heard of; this Prince made the Cavalry march and lead the Artillery over great Arms of the Sea, where before a Man on foot would have been afraid of venturing himſelf: True it is, that formerly ſome Battels have been fought there upon the Ice, but commonly the War was made, in thoſe Parts, by Land in Winter, and by Sea in Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> was the ancient abode of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> It belongs to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who has his Reſidence at <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and holds of the Crown of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The City of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> has the remains of the Re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments which were made there, at divers times, to hinder entrance into the <hi>Peninſula.</hi> One of the late Dukes of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> cauſed <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derickſtadt</hi> to be built upon the <hi>Eider,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſetling there the <hi>Guild-Trade:</hi> He ſent, in the Year 1633. for that purpoſe, a ſignal Embaſſie into <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> whereof we have both a fine and an exact Relation, drawn up by <hi>Olearius,</hi> Secretary of the Embaſſie. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Holſatia,</hi> belongs to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who have hitherto done Homage for it to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as Fief of the Empire, and have had alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately the adminiſtration of Juſtice, the Seſſion in the Aſſemblies of the Empire, and in all the Rights of Regality.

                  <p>The greateſt Iſles of <hi>Denmark</hi> are <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Fionia. Copenhagen,</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> is a Town of great Commerce, the uſual abode of the King. It has a fine Caſtle-Royal, good Fortifications, which afforded its Inhabitants the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſing the <hi>Suedes</hi> in the late Wars.

                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Fionia</hi> is the <hi>Appennage</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Its City of <hi>Ottenſec</hi> was the place of holding the General Aſſemblies of the Kingdom, which, ſince the Year 1660. are to be held at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi>

                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Bornholm</hi> was yielded to the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> by the laſt Treaty of Peace; ſince which, the <hi>Danes</hi> have given, in Exchange

Its Coaſt, though of a vaſt extent, has few good Harbours, by reaſon of the ſmall Iſlands, Rocks and Shelves, wherewith they are environed. The Gulph of <hi>Maclſtroon</hi> is alſo ſaid to ſwallow up the Ships which approach it. What is towards the Pole, is full of Foreſts and of Mountains, which have ſome Mines of Iron and of Copper. In the Year 1646. near <hi>Opſlo,</hi> was a Mine of Gold diſcovered, which gave the Inhabitants occaſion to Publiſh abroad, <hi>That they had the</hi> Northern-Indies; this advantage laſted but as long as the Mine, which was afterwards quickly at an end, by over-much working.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom has five Governments, with as many Caſtles, <hi>Bahus, Aggerhus, Barghenhus, Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, Vardhus.</hi> That of <hi>Bahus,</hi> with a Caſtle of the ſame Name, upon a Rock, was yielded to the <hi>Suedes</hi> by the late Peace. <hi>Berghen</hi> is the beſt City, the Reſidence of the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> with the new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs <hi>Bourg,</hi> and a Sea-Port, where the Ships do eaſily touch, and are ſafe from all Winds, by the means of high Mountains wherewith it is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. The Merchants of the <hi>Anſeatick</hi> Towns have their Magazines. <hi>Dronthem,</hi> the abode of the ancient Kings of <hi>Norway,</hi> is very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed: It has ſtill the Title of an Arch-Biſho p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:153186:160"/>with the remains of one of the Fineſt and moſt Magnificent Churches in the <hi>North.</hi> Ships are ſecure in that Harbour, but have occaſion for good Pilots to bring 'em in. The other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Havens, of this Kingdom, are in the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> part. In ſome Countries of this Region, is Bread made of the flower of Barley and Oats, which they bake between two hollow Flints; this Bread will keep, as they ſay, thirty or forty years. The <hi>Norwegians</hi> are little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diſcourſes, of ſuch a conſtitution, that when they are in a Feaver, a ſlice of a Gammon of Bacon does 'em more good than a new-laid Egg; the inclination of ſeveral of them to Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, makes 'em have the reputation of ſelling Winds to Saylors.</p>

                  <p>The Treaty of <hi>Oliva</hi> in the year 1660. was ſo advantageous to <hi>Sueden,</hi> that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> did there make renunciation of the Title of King of <hi>Sueden</hi> for the future, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving only to himſelf the Title during his life to other Princes; and likewiſe conſented that <hi>Lifeland</hi> ſhould henceforward be Hereditary to the Crown of <hi>Sueden.</hi> This is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>Lifeland</hi> on the North of the <hi>Duna,</hi> where the only place of <hi>Dunembourg</hi> was reſerved to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Truce made at <hi>Stumſdorf</hi> for twenty ſix years, in the year 1635.</p>

                  <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> has lately very much augmented his Revenue, by the re-union to his Demeſne of ſeveral Lands which had been Alienated from it. He pretends to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Gleves,</hi> and of <hi>Juliers,</hi> by the means of his great Grandfather <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Deux-Ponts,</hi> who married <hi>Magdelain</hi> the third Siſter of the Duke of <hi>John William.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sueden</hi> poſſeſſes part of <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> which is the beſt of it, as being towards the Eaſt. The Cold is ſomewhat long in this Country, often very ſharp; to provide themſelves againſt it, the Inhabitants do not make uſe of Furres
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:153186:162"/>as they do in <hi>Germany:</hi> they have only Night-Caps, Gloves of Wool, Waiſt-Coats, and make great Fires of the Fewel they have plenty of. They have ſo few ſick People in their Countrey, that the Phyſitians and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have hardly practice among 'em, whereas Barbers are there in great requeſt. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Officers of Juſtice do there keep Inns. The Inhabitants of this Province are all equally rich; their greateſt Revenues conſiſt in Mines of Copper, from whence moſt of the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are furniſh'd wherewith to make money, their Canons, and their Bells. The City of <hi>Stockholme</hi> alone has in its Caſtle above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pieces of great Artillery; and there are held to be above eight Thouſand in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In the review of the Militia which was made in the year 1661. there were reckoned above Fourſcore Thouſand Men in Arms.</p>
                  <p>This Countrey, being full of Woods and Mountains, affords very little Corn; in time of ſcarcity, the Poor eat often very bad Bread. It furniſhes Butter, Suet, Hides, Skins, Pitch, Roſin, Maſts, Poſts and Planks. The Towns are ſubject to Fire, the Houſes being only built of Wood. The Lakes and Gulphs are there more conſiderable than the Rivers. Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only drove upon the Coaſts; neither dare the Ships venture upon that without a Pylot, by reaſon of the number of Rockswith which it is beſet. The Ice is here ſo ſtrong and firm in Winter, that when it is but two Inches thick, it is ſaid to be able to bear a Man on Foot: Waggons go on it with ſafety when it is half a foot thick. The Snow does there afford the means of travelling in Sledges. The Horſes
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:153186:162"/>in this Countrey are proper for War; they are very eaſily reared and rarely ſick; they ſee as well almoſt by night as by day, they carry their man ſwimming, with eaſe they leap great Ditches; they have ſo much courage and agility, that they attack with their Feet and Teeth the Enemies of thoſe who mount them.</p>
                  <p>Six great Regions are principally known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Sueden; Gotia, Sueden, Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Finland, Ingria, Lifeland;</hi> the three former towards the Weſt, the three other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, the Gulph of <hi>Finland</hi> between both, and beſides theſe the modern acquiſitions before ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gotia</hi> is divided into <hi>Oſtro-Gotia</hi> and <hi>Weſtro-Gotia,</hi> this laſt towards the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the former upon the <hi>Baltick Sea.</hi> According to the like diviſion, the <hi>Goths</hi> who ſubdued <hi>Italy,</hi> were called <hi>Oſtro-Goths,</hi> and thoſe who rendred themſelves Maſters of <hi>Spain, Viſi-Goths. Calmar</hi> is a ſtrong Town, and the place where the <hi>Suedes</hi> until now, did embark for <hi>Germany.</hi> Its Cittadel was eſteemed in the Northern Countreys as much as that of <hi>Milan</hi> in <hi>Italy; Norkoping</hi> has works and forges of Copper which afford the <hi>Europeans</hi> the conveniency of coming to load Cannon there. <hi>Lindkoping</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the Hiſtorian <hi>Olaus-Magnus</hi> is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Victory of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sudermania,</hi> ſince King of <hi>Sueden.</hi> There be ſeveral Cities in theſe parts whoſe names be thus terminated in <hi>Koping,</hi> which ſignifies the places where the market is kept. <hi>Gottembourg</hi> a new Town, and has its Sea-Port upon the Ocean.</p>

                     <hi>Sueden</hi> properly taken communicates its name to the other Provinces of this State. <hi>Stockholme</hi> is the Capital City of all the Kingdom, accompanied with a Royal Caſtle and a Sea-Port at the diſgorging of the Lake of <hi>Meler,</hi> whereof was formerly the conjunction propoſed with that of <hi>Wener,</hi> for the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the Ocean and Baltick Seas, and thus be exempted from the paſſage of the Sound. This <hi>Town</hi> is now better built, and much richer than it was before the War of the <hi>Suedes</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> In the year 1641. they began to make the Streets in Right Lines, and to build their Houſes of one and the ſame Structure. It is a ſafe Harbour for Ships, which may ride there in ſecurity without Anchor. There be three Channels which lead thither between ſeveral Iſles and Rocks. The Kings Ships remain at <hi>Elſnappen.</hi> The Country round about is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd with ſeveral fine Houſes, which the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns and moſt of the Senators have cauſ'd to be built. <hi>Upſal,</hi> accompanied with a great Caſtle, is the Metropolitan, and formerly the place of the Coronation of their Kings, whoſe abode it formerly was. When in <hi>Sueden</hi> were ſeveral Kingdoms, that of <hi>Upſal</hi> was ever the moſt conſiderable of 'em This City has an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and the moſt renowned Fairs of all thoſe parts. Its principall Church was a ſtately Building and is ſaid to have been embeliſh'd and wainſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gold, now it is covered with Copper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lapland</hi> has no Towns, only ſome Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions divided into five Countries, which bear the name of their Rivers. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> are very low of Stature, the talleſt among them not exceeding four Foot in height. They have no
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:153186:163"/>other Cloaths than of Skins; and when they are young, they are ſo hardned to the cold, that they afterwards undergo it with eaſe, when without habilliments. They have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wool, nor Flax, nor Hemp; they have blades of Copper which they call <hi>Cipons,</hi> which they exchange for what they ſtand in need of: they have neither Bread, nor Corn, nor Fruits, nor Herbs, nor Wines, nor Beer, nor Cattle, nor Eggs, nor Milk, nor any other Commodity; but they do not want Water: and they have Rain-Deers; which are a kind of a Stag extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſwift, whoſe fleſh is their Food: and whom they alſo make uſe of in their Travels. The great and ſwift Journies they go by their means, having given occaſion to the believing them Witches. But to proceed, there is one part of <hi>Lapland</hi> belonging to the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and another to the <hi>Muſcovite.</hi> Mount <hi>Enarby</hi> has three Lodges for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the three Nations, and there the <hi>Suedes</hi> adminiſter Inſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finland</hi> is a Dutchy which ſome Kings of <hi>Sueden</hi> have given for Appanage for their Brothers. The principal Towns are <hi>Abbo</hi> and <hi>Nibourg.</hi> There is in this Province a place near <hi>Ratzebourg,</hi> where Needles toucht with the Loadſtone are ſaid to turn continually.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ingria</hi> was taken from the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> by a Treaty in the Year 1617. It is ſmall, but conſiderable for the hunting of <hi>Elks</hi> and for the Scituation of the Fortreſs of <hi>Notebourg</hi> in the midſt of a great River, and at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorging of the Lake <hi>Ladoga.</hi> This Fortreſs was taken miraculouſly by the <hi>Suede,</hi> all the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Garriſon, except two Perſons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lifeland</hi> was ceded entirely by <hi>Poland,</hi> as we have ſaid, except <hi>Dunembourg.</hi> It was formerly the order of the Knights Sword-Bearers; but under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9th this Order was united to that of the <hi>Teutons,</hi> or Croſs-Bearers. The <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had it afterwards in poſſeſſion. The Dutchy of <hi>Courland,</hi> has its Duke of the Family of <hi>Ketler,</hi> who does Homage to <hi>Poland.</hi> It is a remnant of the great Maſterſhip of the above mentioned order. <hi>Riga</hi> is the Capital Town of <hi>Lifeland.</hi> The <hi>Germans, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> trade much to that Town in Summer-time, while the Sea is navigable. In the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Inhabitants traffick into <hi>Muſcovy</hi> by means of their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is in a Plain upon the River <hi>de Dune,</hi> which in that place is a quarter of a League in breadth: Its Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations conſiſt in ſix regular Baſtions, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral half Moons freezed, and in Counterſcarps palliſadoed. The <hi>Dune</hi> has ſo rapid a Stream and often whirles along ſo much Ice, that it ſometimes changes its courſe from <hi>Riga</hi> as far as <hi>Dunemund.</hi> In the Year 1656. I ſaw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of an hundred thouſand <hi>Muſcovites</hi> waſt and moulder away before that Town, which glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repulſed their efforts. <hi>Revel</hi> has the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commerce from <hi>Lifeland</hi> unto <hi>Muſcovy. Nerva</hi> is a ſtrong place which beſtows its Name upon a neighbouring River, wherein the brave <hi>Pontus de la Gardie</hi> was drowned, after <hi>Sueden</hi> was obliged to him for many of its beſt Conqueſts. By the late Treaties between
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:153186:164"/>the Crowns of <hi>Sueden</hi> and of <hi>Poland,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of both the Catholique and Proteſtant Religion is allowed of in <hi>Lifeland,</hi> as well as in <hi>Curland</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>

                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Gotland,</hi> the greateſt of the Iſles of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, accompanied with five or ſix Havens, belongs to the Crown of <hi>Sueden.</hi> Several of its Rocks have ancient <hi>Gothick</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. Its City of <hi>Wiſby</hi> ſtill preſerves Marbles and Houſes which have Doors of Iron and Braſs, either waſht with Silver, or guilt with Gold; which ſpeaks its ancient Grandure.

                     <hi>POland,</hi> which was formerly but a part of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> is now the Kingdom of <hi>Europe,</hi> of the greateſt extent.

The Mouths of the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> are poſſeſſed by the Turk, who in the Year 1672 received the <hi>Ukrain</hi> into his protection, after having ſubdued <hi>Podolia</hi> by the ſacking of <hi>Caminiec.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> is Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive the only one of <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have kept the right of chooſing a Prince. The government is that of an Ariſtocratical Monarchy, wherein the Senators have ſo much Authority, that when they mention the State, they ſay the Kingdom and Republick of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Senate is compoſed of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhhops, Biſhops, Pallatines, Principal <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> and the great Officers of the Kingdom. The King, like that of Bees, can do no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to his Subjects; that is to ſay, he cannot in any wiſe act againſt any of the Nobility without the conſent of the Senators, and he can do 'em a great deal of good on his own part; by beſtowing on them vacant places. His Perſon and his Dignity are ſo conſidered, that it has not been known that ever any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made upon any Kings Life of his Predeceſſors. Before the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> the 3d. there were only Princes in this State, that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour recalled the Tribute which <hi>Poland</hi> paid the Empire. <hi>Warſaw</hi> is the uſual place of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of the general Dyets; <hi>Cracow</hi> that of the Coronation of the Kings. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſne</hi> Primate of the Kingdom, performs this Coronation, and has almoſt the whole Authority during the <hi>Interregnum;</hi> for then he preſides in the Senate, and gives Audience to Embaſſadors. He conteſts the Preſidence
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:153186:165"/>with Cardinals; for which reaſon there are three Orders; the Church, the Nobility, and the third Eſtate, which comprehends all thoſe which are not Noble. The Nobility is ſo numerous in this Realm, that <hi>Poland</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kingdom of the Nobles. In the Dyets the <hi>Nuncio's,</hi> who are the Deputies of the leſſer Nobility, or Gentry of the Provinces, do often overſway the reſt of the Dyet. But one amongſt 'em has ſometimes the Authority to cauſe a whole general Dyet to be broke up by a Proteſtation. As the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is obſerved in this Realm, ſo the Biſhops have the firſt rank after the King, then the Palatines and the <hi>Caſtellains.</hi> The <hi>Caſtellains</hi> of <hi>Cracow</hi> is above the Palaine of the ſame name, becauſe that formerly the <hi>Chaſtellain</hi> behaved himſelf more valiantly than did the Palatine, in defence of the Kingdom: alſo does he wear a Royal Crown at the anointing of his Majeſty; at which Ceremony he precedes all the other Secular Senators: The Palatine of <hi>Cracow</hi> carries the Scepter. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſne</hi> and of <hi>Leopold,</hi> have under them ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſeventeeen Biſhops, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as without the Kingdom. There be three other Schiſmaticks in black <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who firſt of all acknowledge him of <hi>Kiou,</hi> and then the Greek Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> There is in this State ſeveral other Sects. Here Gentlemen are equall, the diſtinction, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence proceeding only from the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they ſtand poſſeſs'd of: they ſerve at their own coſts in time of Wars, but do not ſtay long in the Campagne. Their infantry is commonly compos'd of Forreigners. The
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:153186:166"/>Garments of the <hi>Polanders</hi> are long, have their Beards ſhaved off their Chins, only one Tuff of Hair upon their Heads, upon the occaſion of <hi>Caſimir</hi> the firſt, one of their Kings, whom they took out of a Cloiſter he was in in <hi>France,</hi> to place him upon their Throne. They are almoſt all handſome, well ſhaped, well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, knowing for the moſt part the Latin Tongue. The uſe of Spices is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and with them in great requeſt; they miſuſe their Peaſants, in conſequence, of the abſolute Power they have over them; which certainly did occaſion the revolt of the <hi>Coſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi> and afterwards all the diſorders of the Kingdom. Their Cavalary is ſo conſiderable, that if they were well united, they might bring into the Field a hundred thouſand Horſe: The confidence they have therein, and the fear of rendring a King or Citizens too powerful, have inclined them in all times to neglect their Fortreſſes. Their uſual Arms are their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter, the Sword, the Battel Ax, Carabine and Arrows. The <hi>Coſſaques</hi> have ever formed a Militia, and not a particular Nation. At the firſt they were Volunteers, making incurſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turks</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Tartars;</hi> theſe laſt call them by the Name of <hi>Roux,</hi> becauſe their Country makes a part of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> King <hi>Battori</hi> reduced them into a Body, and joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two thouſand Horſe, to whom he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fourth part of the Revenue of his Demeſne, for which reaſons they were called <hi>Quartians.</hi> They have power of chooſing and of depoſing their General, who takes an Oath of Fidelity to their King. Their number was firſt of all ſix thouſand, afterwards forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:153186:166"/>ſand, and now ſince twenty thouſand. Their abode is in the lower parts of <hi>Volhinia,</hi> and of <hi>Podolia,</hi> which is called <hi>Ukrain,</hi> that is to ſay Frontier. This Country is by much the moſt fertile, and the beſt inhabited of all <hi>Poland;</hi> ſo many fortified Buroughs have been there made ſince the beginning of this Age, and ſo full is it of Inhabitants, that in the late Wars there were reckoned at the ſame time two hundred thouſand <hi>Coſſaques,</hi> beſides a hundred and fourſcore thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> and as many <hi>Polanders</hi> in Arms. There be <hi>Coſſaques</hi> who have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats in ſome Iſles of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> which is not Navigable by reaſon of the Cataracts or falls, which they call <hi>Porowis.</hi> Their Cuſtom was formerly to put to Sea with ſeveral light Ships, and to go plunder the Coaſts of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> upon the Black Sea. Since they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with the leſſer <hi>Tartars,</hi> and have likewiſe courted the Protection of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite,</hi> and that of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who gave them in his name a Prince for the <hi>Ukrain,</hi> inſomuch that we may ſay that the Felony of the <hi>Coſſaques,</hi> the Irruption of the <hi>Suedes</hi> under <hi>Carolus Guſtavus,</hi> the Tumults and Irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the continual haraſſings of the leſſer <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Invaſion of <hi>Ragotski</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> the defection of ſeveral Provinces, the Inſurrections of the whole Armies of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> the different Factions of the Kingdom, and the Caballs of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations to have a King Elected, have given a rude ſhock to this Crown.

Low <hi>Poland,</hi> though much ſmaller than the Higher, is called Great, becauſe it makes part of the Kingdom rather than the other. Its City of <hi>Gneſne</hi> is ancient, the abode of the firſt Princes. It was ſo called upon the account of an Eagles Neſt that was there found when it was built; and which gave occaſion to the Arms of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> which art <hi>Gules,</hi> an Eagle-Argent Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beaked and Armed, Or, bound under the Wings with a Ribbon of the ſame.

                  <p>THis is the vaſteſt Country of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſtiled formerly <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> now <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> It is called Great and White <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> from the name of the ancient <hi>Roxolan</hi> People, and upon the account of its great extent, and of the Snow, which ſo covers the Ground near two thirds of the year, that to Travel there at that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:153186:169"/>time, one would have occaſion to veil ones Eyes with black Crape, ſo as formerly <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> made his Souldiers do in the retreat of the ten thouſand <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Soyl of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> is cold, humid, full of Woods and Bogs, which make it little inhabited.</p>
                  <p>What makes it believed that it is better populated than it really is, is that the Country People by expreſs order, go to the avenues of the Citties, through which the Embaſſadours of forreign Princes paſs. The cold there does often hinder the Corn from coming to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is there ſometimes ſo violent, that the Earth is wholly opened by it; the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants find it no extraordinary matter to ſee their Noſe, Ears and Feet frozen; they only ſow in them parts in the Month of <hi>June;</hi> the heats of <hi>July</hi> and of <hi>Auguſt</hi> do viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forward the Harveſt. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> do not willingly afford the entrance of their Countrey to other Nations; they care not to know any other Tongues than their own; they only have their Children taught to write and read, that is ſufficient to be a Doctor. They take for their Sirname the proper Name of their Father; they write upon Roles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cut into Welts and glued together, to the length of twenty or five and twenty Yards; they reckon the firſt day of the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> for the firſt of the Year: they wear long Garments, and put their Girdle below their Belly. Their Collations are performed with the Bread of Spices, of Brandy and of Honey.

Their Forts are commonly of Wood and of Earth upon the ſinuoſities of Rivers or elſe in Lakes. The greateſt ſtrength of the State conſiſts in forreign Troops; and good pay and Penſions are given to the Officers when they have occaſion for them. The Prince has the Title of the Great Duke, ſays he is diſcended from <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> ſtiles himſelf Grand <hi>Tzaar</hi> or <hi>Gzar,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Gaeſar</hi> and Emperour. The Habiliments he is bound to wear, make him appear like a Prelate. When the Miniſters of Forreign Princes are to treat with his Embaſſadours, they have all the pain imaginable to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Titles by reaſon of his extraordinary

The Country borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the leſſer <hi>Tartars</hi> is wholly Deſart by the incurſions of thoſe People who go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make Slaves to ſell them in the <hi>Crim,</hi> from, whence they are led to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> as there are very handſom Women amongſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:153186:170"/>thoſe ſlaves, they ever meet with Chapmen who take them off their hands. The Paliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd Hedges of Wood, and the Ditch that was made a hundred Leagues in length, have not been capable to ſtop thoſe Incurſions. They have treated the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> with ſo many indignities in the foregoing ages, that beſides the Tribute, the Prince of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> was bound to light off his Horſe before the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>Tartary,</hi> to offer him a Diſh of Milck, to lick up what by chance might fall upon the Horſes Creſt, to keep ſtanding and bare headed, the <hi>Tartar</hi> being ſeated. The Religion of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> is little different from that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> all their Images are in Board Pictures; St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> is the Protectour of their Nation, they have ſeldom any Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals but on the day of the Bleſſed Virgins An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unciation; they have at <hi>Moſco</hi> a Patriarch the head of their Religion, three Archbiſhops and Metropolitans at <hi>Roſthou,</hi> at <hi>Suſdal,</hi> and at Great <hi>Novogorode,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wologda, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, Suſdal, Tuvere, Tobeleſca, Aſtracan, Caſan, Pleſcou, Colomna</hi> and almoſt in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Great Duke,</hi> where they are choſen out of the Body of the Monks.

                     <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is divided into two parts <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Northern,</hi> the former towards the <hi>Wolga,</hi> the latter towares the <hi>Duvine,</hi> which <hi>Wolga</hi>
                     <pb n="374" facs="tcp:153186:171"/>the greateſt River of <hi>Europe,</hi> falls into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, after having run a courſe of about ſeven hundred Leagues. The <hi>Duvine</hi> which waters the moſt trading Towns of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> empties it ſelf by ſix or ſeven Mouths into the Gulph of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which is called the <hi>White Sea,</hi> by reaſon of the Snow of the Country thereabouts. The <hi>Dom</hi> which ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Aſia</hi> has its beginning a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues from its end; its Courſe is about ſix hundred Leagues, firſt towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> afterwards towards the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of theſe three Rivers was formerly propoſed for the communication of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Seas of our Continent, that is to ſay for the facillitating the Commerce of the <hi>Ocean, Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Caſpian</hi> Seas. But this deſign did not ſucceed by reaſon of the divers Intereſts of the Neighbouring Princes. The Rivers of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> have this in particular, that they have not any Carps. There be few good Towns in all thoſe Parts, they are not paved, ſome that are boarded with Wood, nor walled for the moſt part, the Lands being till'd and plow'd between the ſtreets: the Houſes below made of Wood and Mud; in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets their Houſes are to be ſold, wholly prepared, and ready to be ſet up. There often happen Fires by reaſon of that combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is eaſily lighted and enflamed by the number of Candles that are lighted before the Images, and which the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drunk, do not take care to extinguiſh.</p>

                     <hi>Moſco</hi> the Capital City, and the Reſidence of the <hi>Great Duke</hi> ſeems rather a heap of ſeveral Boroughs, than a good City. It has had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:153186:171"/>thouſand Houſes, but has leſs ſince, it has been pillaged at divers times by the leſſer <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and ſince the late burning down of moſt part of its Houſes. Its two Caſtles were built by <hi>Italian</hi> Ingeniers after the Model of that of <hi>Milan. Volodimere</hi> the Reſidence of the Prince before that of <hi>Moſcow,</hi> is in the moſt fertile part of all <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> accompanied with a Caſtle. The Rivers of <hi>Moſcow</hi> and of <hi>Occa</hi> furniſh the Inhabitants of <hi>Moſcow</hi> with the means of making their Merchandize deſcend upon the <hi>Volga.</hi> The leſſer <hi>Novogorod</hi> is the laſt City of <hi>Europe</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt. Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou</hi> is well fortifyed, as being a Bulwark againſt the <hi>Polanders</hi> and the <hi>Suedes.</hi> Great <hi>Novogorod</hi> was one of the four Magazines of the Hanſe-Towns, and a Town ſo rich and puiſſant, that it was formerly a ſaying of its Citizens, <hi>that nothing could oppoſe God or great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorod.</hi> In the year 1577. the <hi>Great Duke</hi> took it, and is ſaid to have carried away from thence three hundred Waggons loaded with Gold and Silver. It is ſtill at this day a Town of great Commerce. <hi>Archangel</hi> or St. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel</hi> is the ſtaple of all <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> by reaſon of its Sea-Port. The Cuſtoms there mount to above ſix hundred thouſand Crowns a year. This place was both firſt diſcovered and firſt frequented by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, but have been followed by other Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> Before, the Commerce of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> was carryed on by paſſing through the <hi>Sound,</hi> and reſorting to <hi>Nerva;</hi> the great Impoſitions laid upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize by the Princes through whoſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories they were to paſs, have made Merchants abandon that way. St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> drives alſo a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:153186:172"/>great Trade at the entrance of the <hi>Duvin</hi> theſe are the only good. Places of the Grea Duke upon the <hi>Ocean. Colmogorod</hi> is noted for the faires that are held there in Winter. The <hi>Duvine</hi> there receives great Ships. <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioug</hi> is in the Center of the Countrey, where its traffick is pretty conſiderable by means of its Scituation at the meeting of two Rivers. The Intereſt of the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> would be to have a place upon the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> for the Cannons, Muskets and other ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War which he has brought him from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> are conveyed by the North of <hi>Norway</hi> with extraordinary pain and trouble. Beſides, the White Sea has Banks and Rocks at its entrance; the Snow thaw'd and melted, and the Torrents which augment it in the Spring, carry its Waters with ſuch impetuoſity, that the Ships can hardly enter therein: true it is that abundance of Salmon are taken there. <hi>Kola</hi> and <hi>Pitzora</hi> in <hi>Lapland</hi> receive Merchants Ships.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Conqueſt of the <hi>Great Duke</hi> in <hi>Aſiatick Tartary,</hi> there is principally <hi>Aſtracan</hi> and <hi>Caſan</hi> with Titles of Kingdoms, and the <hi>Hurdes</hi> of <hi>Zavolha</hi> and <hi>Nagaia: Aſtracan</hi> towards the Mouth of the <hi>Wolga</hi> drives a great traffick upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. In this Country is the Plant <hi>Zoophite</hi> which reſembles a Lamb; it eats the Herbs round about its Root, and if it be cut it caſts forth a red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor like to bloud; the Wolves devour it with as much greedineſs and avidity as if it were a Sheep. <hi>Locomoria</hi> towards the <hi>Obi,</hi> has Inhabitants which be ſaid to be frozen up ſix months of the year, becauſe that during a
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:153186:172"/>that time they dwell in Tents environed and covered with Snow, and do not ſtir out from thence until it be thaw'd and melted away. The <hi>Samoiedes</hi> are ſeldom above four foot tall: they are ſaid to have a very broad Face, little Eyes, the head on one ſide is much greater than the proportion of the Body does require it, ſhort Legs, extraordinary great Feet, becauſe they ſeem ſo in the Skins of Animals they cloath themſelves with, and the ſtuff whereof they make their ſhoes; they wear thoſe Skins in ſuch manner, that in Winter they turn the hairy ſide inwards, and wear it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Summer: to ſow them they have the bones of Fiſh, and the Nerves of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals inſtead of Needles and thread; they have the beſt Archers in the World.

                  <p>ALl the Territories of the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Grand-Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> are generally known under the Name of <hi>Turkey.</hi> This Name is made to come from that of <hi>Turcheſtan</hi> one of the Regions of great <hi>Tartary,</hi> from whence they went out Shepherds, who ſetled themſelves firſt of all in <hi>Natolia,</hi> and afterwards divided themſelves into ſeveral Cantons under divers Chiefs. <hi>Ottoman</hi> one of thoſe Chiefs govern'd ſo prudently, and was accompanyed with ſuch ſucceſs, that after the death of <hi>Aladin</hi> one of the Princes of the Country, he remained Maſter of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and gave beginning to that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire about the year 1300. His Succeſſors have been to the number of twenty two, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence was firſt of all at <hi>Burſe</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and at laſt at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</hi> They have cauſed to be built in thoſe Cities their ſtately Pallaces, which they call <hi>Serraglios.</hi> Moſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours hitherto have ſeldom ſtirred out from thence but to the Army, or on Progreſs; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpend their dayes with Children, Women, Eunuchs, Mutes and Dwarfs: their fineſt <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> are Captives, or thoſe who proceed from the moſt Beautiful Perſons which are kept at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as breeding Horſes, after that the leſſer <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are the <hi>Turks</hi>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:153186:173"/>Hunters have brought them thither. Theſe Emperours make a Conſcience of ſpending what they exact from the People otherwiſe than in War; they have a particular Treaſury wherein they keep this Revenue; for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their Family ſeveral of them chooſe a Trade, which they actually work in.</p>
                  <p>In leſs than three hundred years the <hi>Turks</hi> have made Conqueſts in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> as conſiderable as thoſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which took them up about eight hundred years; they keep ſo well what they acquire, that it is hardly poſſible to diſlodge them from thence. True it is their Provinces are not Populous like thoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> War and Peſtilence ſweeping away a great number of their Men; their Lands do not afford ſuch great Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as formerly, the <hi>Turks</hi> being extraordinary lazy, and too preſumptuous to cultivate it; their Cuſtom is to ruine the Citys, and to keep only the moſt important Places of that Frontier: from whence it comes, that moſt of the Cities of <hi>Turkey</hi> are without Walls, and much ſmaller than their Suburbs The <hi>Turks</hi> have it for a Proverb, <hi>that their grows no more graſs where there Horſes have once fet footing.</hi> The Countrys of their Empire have their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity very different, by reaſon of their diverſe Scituations; thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> are the beſt and moſt Beautiful, though one may take whole days Journeys there without meeting with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Burroughs or Villages; thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> are ſtill more deſart. What is in <hi>Africa</hi> is only inhabited towards the Coaſt, and near the great Cities. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is ſo called by reaſon of the abſolute Power he has
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:153186:174"/>generally in all his Dominions, and over all His Subjects, and not upon the account of the extent of his Empire, for there be Soveraigns which poſſeſs much more Land than he does; their Lands paſs from the Father to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, theſe only enjoy them as uſufructuaries and not as Proprietors. There be ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as <hi>Turcomania</hi> and <hi>Curdiſtan,</hi> where the Inhabitants have them in propriety. There be no other Gentlemen in <hi>Turkey</hi> than the Princes Officers, who are obeyed by the reſt of the People. His Higneſs takes upon him very extraordinary Titles: <hi>Soliman</hi> the 2d. ſaid, that one of his ſmalleſt Territories was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>The Religion of the <hi>Turks</hi> is that of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> a Native of <hi>Mecca.</hi> There goes every year to that Town a great Number of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> in <hi>Caravans,</hi> each of thirty or forty thouſand Perſons. The Places of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Turkey</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Cairo</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Zibith,</hi> or <hi>Aden,</hi> or <hi>Mocca,</hi> for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; Bagdad</hi> for the <hi>Perſians.</hi> A fifth <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan</hi> there is, which is that of <hi>Barbareſques</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi> Amongſt other things which <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſetled by his Law, he prohibited thoſe of his Sect Wine and gaming, for to take away all occaſion of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and of quarrel which might have aroſe amongſt them. Nevertheleſs, tho' during the encampments there be abſtinence from Wine, yet amongſt ten <hi>Turks</hi> there is ſeldom found one but who's a Drunkard. He would not that any <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſhoud be Slaves, for he who firſt received his Inſtructions was one of his Slaves cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:153186:174"/>
                     <hi>Zeidin,</hi> whom he made a Freeman for that reaſon. He ordered that Prayers ſhould be ſaid five times in the day, and that for a Month ſhould be kept a Lent called <hi>Ramedan;</hi> faſting is there obſerved all the day long by ſome <hi>Turks</hi> with ſo much ſcruple, that going along the ſtreets they wear a Crape before their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for fear that in breathing they ſhould ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Fly or a drop of Rain, Water or Duſt. They ſhut their Teeth on the ſame ſcore, and dare not ſo much as ſwallow their Spittle; they take each day for divers intentions, <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> for the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> who are thoſe of their Law, <hi>Saturday</hi> for the converſion of the <hi>Jews, Sunday</hi> for that of the <hi>Chriſtians, Monday</hi> for the Prophets, <hi>Tueſday</hi> for the Prieſts and <hi>Chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, Wedneſday</hi> for the Dead, for the ſick, and for the Slaves, <hi>Thurſday</hi> for all the World. There be <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Turkey</hi> and ſeveral other Sect a great number of Catholicks, of the Religious of ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Orders, who have there their eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>The common liquor of the <hi>Turks</hi> is <hi>Sorbet,</hi> which is very delicious to drink; their Coffee warms and fortifies the Stomack: When they make their greateſt Regale, they give Coffee, Sorbet and Perfumes. It is the cuſtom of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Perſon they go to ſee, this cuſtom is practiſed almoſt through all the Levant: their <hi>Zizi</hi> or Purſes are each worth eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Piaſters, The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> takes a Pride in cloathing thoſe who come near his Perſon, to whom they are led by holding them under the Arms, ſince the aſſaſſination of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> the 1. The <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongues are there in eſteem, though the <hi>Turks</hi> hold it
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:153186:175"/>for an Honour to underſtand no other than their own.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Turkey</hi> contains thirty <hi>Beglierbyats,</hi> which are as many general Governments, on which depend ſeveral <hi>Sangiacats,</hi> or particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, with ſeveral Caſtles. <hi>Natolea</hi> at <hi>Chioutaie, Caramania</hi> at <hi>Cogni, Diarbekir, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſeus, Sivas</hi> at <hi>Amaſie, Erzerum, Van, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilder, Scheherezul, Aleppo, Maras, Cyprus, Tripoli</hi> of <hi>Souria, Trebizonde, Kars, Moſul</hi> or <hi>Ninevah, Rika:</hi> all this in <hi>Aſia.</hi> In <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> there is <hi>Rumeli</hi> at <hi>Sophia,</hi> that of the Sea at <hi>Gallipoli, Budah, Temeſvar, Boſna, Caffa, Candia.</hi> Each Beglerbyat has its Revenue affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon its Government. Thoſe of <hi>Kairo,</hi> of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> of <hi>Lazac,</hi> of <hi>Yaman,</hi> or of <hi>Aden,</hi> of <hi>Abex,</hi> of <hi>Baſſora</hi> have theirs out of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> fund; thoſe three laſt Governments have been taken from the <hi>Turks.</hi> Moſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are called <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> that is to ſay, Chiefs. They have Rank according to the ancientneſs of the Conqueſts, and of the places whereof they are Governours. A <hi>Beglier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> has three Tougs, a Toug is a Horſes Tail at the end of a half Pike that is carryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him. A <hi>Baſhaw</hi> has two, and a <hi>Sangiac</hi> has but one. Beſides the <hi>Prime Viſier</hi> who is all mighty, there be five <hi>Viſiers</hi> or Chancellours of State, thoſe of <hi>Natolia,</hi> of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> of <hi>Rumeli,</hi> and of <hi>Buda.</hi> The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> gives no conſiderable Government to his eldeſt Son, for fear it ſhould prove of ill conſequence as it has done to ſome of his Predeceſſours. The coming of him to the Empire, is often the Sentence of Death to the other Brothers, who are in the mean time kept like poor Victims in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:153186:175"/>the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> It has been obſerved in this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> that the youngeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have often attained to the Empire, to the excluſion of their Eldeſt; when the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> means to humble any of his <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> he makes him marry one of his Siſters, or ſome other of his Relations. The Court of the Prince is called the Port, becauſe all muſt dance attendance at the door; the Rank of the left hand which is the ſide of the Sword, is in <hi>Turkey</hi> the moſt honourable, whether in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or in the march of Armies: Such <hi>Turks</hi> as are learned ſay that they imitate <hi>Grand Cyrus</hi> herein. I ſay the Learned <hi>Turks,</hi> for ſome of them are ſo little vers'd in Hiſtories and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, that they ſay <hi>Job</hi> was the Judge of the Court of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was General of the Armies of the ſame King. The People of the Law eſteem the Right Side, which is willingly granted them by the Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The Forces of the <hi>Turks</hi> are great, but his Neighbours are puiſſant, and in poſſeſſion of doing him a great deal of miſchief. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> are the moſt conſiderable of them in <hi>Europe:</hi> The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> As the Intereſts of theſe Princes are divers, and that they have not any great Correſpondence with one another, it comes to paſs that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> enlarges the bounds of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to their coſt. As concerning Forces by Sea, the <hi>Turks</hi> have none that are conſiderable, and they have a ſaying. <hi>that if the Sea be for the Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Land is for them.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:153186:176"/>Armies are well diſciplin'd; the belief of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, beſides the uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> renders them capable of all manner of attempts. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Forces conſiſt in the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who compoſe the Infantry; the Horſemen are known under the Name of <hi>Spahis.</hi> Theſe <hi>Spahis</hi> have Lands called <hi>Timars,</hi> and furniſh as many men as their Revenue has ſix and twenty Livers a year. To avoid the hurry and trouble of Moveables; they eat on the ground on a Leathern Carpet: a piece of Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry which they carry upon the Crupper of their Horſe, ſerves them for quilt or mattreſs, for Bolſter or for Cloak. They laugh at the <hi>Franks</hi> who are uſed to walk alone in Rooms, and go very faſt in the Street. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, they repoſe in their Houſes on Velvet Cuſheons, and when they walk, they ſtill keep up their gravity. The Officers and the Guards being in the Court of the <hi>Divan,</hi> which is the Councel, are ſuch obſervers of Silence, that not ſo much as one word is to be heard, though there be often above eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand together. When the Souldiers are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for any Crimes, they give 'em ſeveral blows with a Cudgel; to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> upon their Buttocks, to the <hi>Spahies</hi> under the Sole of the Foot. The Principal Maxims of the <hi>Turks</hi> are to give Offices to Perſons of Merit, not to conſider their Birth; to ruine moſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the ſparing the charge of a Garriſon; and to keep only as long as they pleaſe Treaties made in other Tongues than their own; not to reſtore the good places they have once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, no longer to make their Armies ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that they may the better ſubſiſt, not to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:153186:176"/>allow of Gentlemen, nor ſuffer <hi>Mahometan</hi> to remain Slaves; to make uſe of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in their greateſt expeditions for the better haraſſing and laying waſt their Enemies Countryes, to render the Inſularies reſponſible for the <hi>Turks,</hi> they give them for Governours: to give Military Offices to Children, who are born <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thoſe of the Law to natural <hi>Turks.</hi>

In that engagement a hundred and eighty nine <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys were loſt, five and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Turks</hi> killed, four thouſand made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, twelve thouſand <hi>Chriſtians</hi> freed.

The midſt of that <hi>Peninſula</hi> was formerly inhabited by the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who had in their Countrey the fineſt Aſſes in the World; and who neglected to learn Aſtrology, when the other <hi>Greeks</hi> received it, becauſe they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves more ancient than the Moon. <hi>Patras,</hi> where St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was put upon the Croſs, is one of its beſt Towns. <hi>Modon</hi> the abode of the <hi>Sangiacbey</hi> or Governour of the Province. <hi>Maina</hi> gives its Name to a Petty Countrey, which has no longer the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty it a long time maintained againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> by favour of the Sea, and the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſteepneſs of the Mountains. <hi>Napoli</hi> of <hi>Romania</hi> and <hi>Malvaſia</hi> are peopled on the ſcore of their Sea-Ports, where a great Trade is droven. <hi>Corinth</hi> now ruined, was formerly named the Rich; the conveniency of its Scituation made it be called the Market of <hi>Greece:</hi> Its Inhabitants invented the <hi>Greek</hi> Galleys; after that it was burnt by the <hi>Romans,</hi> there came a mixture of its melted Mettals, which has retained the Name of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Braſs. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three places in <hi>Greece</hi> for ſtrength, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Corinth, Demetrias</hi> and <hi>Calcis.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> named the <hi>Acrocorinth,</hi> and <hi>Ithoma</hi> near <hi>Meſſena,</hi> by reaſon of their Scituations, were called the two Horns of the <hi>Peloponeſus.

Moſt of the Towns of this Country have Names that have very little affinity one with another, becauſe the Nations who gave them at their ſetling themſelves there, had very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tongues. <hi>Hungary</hi> is commonly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into High and Low, the laſt towards the <hi>South</hi> is almoſt wholly in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the former towards the <hi>North</hi> for the moſt part in the hands of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſuch places as have been lately ſeized or revolted with <hi>Count Teckley.</hi> Two parts of it have been ſometimes made, ſeparated from one another by the <hi>Danube,</hi> the one to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> known under the Name of <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the other to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> making part of ancient <hi>Dacia.</hi> There be ſeveral Countreys, the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof is not here very material. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> has there four General Ships, the <hi>Turks</hi> four <hi>Bachalics</hi> or great Governments. When the Realm of <hi>Hungary</hi> was in its Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, it extended to the very <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, as far as <hi>Greece,</hi> and comprehended <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Walachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia;</hi> from whence it came that the Emperour, as King of <hi>Hungary</hi> pretends that the Princes of thoſe three States be allowed of by him. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> has maintained his pretenſion better in that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:153186:182"/>point. The Soyl of <hi>Hungary</hi> is fertile, the Plains are beautiful and afford plenty of Corn, the Hills Wine, which is tranſported into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other places, where it is accounted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; that of <hi>Tokay</hi> is in moſt eſteem. It alſo affords Salt, and other Conveniencies of Life. Several Great Rivers contribute to this abundance, the <hi>Danube, Drave, Save</hi> which have their Sources in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Teyſs</hi> which is entirely <hi>Hungarian.</hi> The <hi>Danube</hi> leads its Waters from the <hi>Weſt</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> through the midſt of the Countrey, with leſs ſwiftnes towards Noon, than towards the Evening and the Morning: after a courſe of above ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues, it falls into the <hi>Black Sea</hi> by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Mouths. The <hi>Teyſs</hi> can carry Boats four Leagues from its Source. It abounds ſo in Fiſh, that they are ſaid to make the third part of its Bed; for which reaſon it often caſts abundance of them upon the Neighbouring Plains; and that in the publick Markets of the Towns, thoſe who retire into the Countrey have order to take them away. Formerly the <hi>Hungarians</hi> put the Figure of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Rivers in their Enſigns or Colours, and ſince they have carryed the Croſs therein, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving embrac'd Chriſtianity under their Prince <hi>Eſthienne,</hi> who for that conſideration obtained of <hi>Pope Silveſter</hi> the 2d. the Title of King, and was crowned in the year 1001.

                  <p>The <hi>Hungarians</hi> are Warlike, neither their Garments nor their Manners be very different from thoſe of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Their Tongues is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:153186:182"/>almoſt wholly peculiar to themſelves, and nevertheleſs the <hi>Latine, Sclavonian, German</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> are in uſe among them. The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2d. allowed the liberty of Religion in this Realm in the year 1622. The Revocation of that Toleration has occaſioned perpetual Revolts, and is the ſource of that great War it is now the Scene of.

Four orders of Perſons have Seſſions in the States, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, the Barons, the Nobles and the Burgeſſes of Free and Royal Cities. The Dignity of <hi>Palatine</hi> is there the moſt conſiderable after that of King, who if he acts in any wiſe againſt their Priviledges, may be oppoſed by force, if the <hi>Palatine</hi> conſent thereto.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:153186:183"/>of Livers every year. He raiſes this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Mines, by an impoſition on each Horſe, and by the exportation of Cattle.

Beſides ſeven or eight good Cities, it has full fourſcore thouſand <hi>Koys,</hi> that is to ſay Wells or Villages. Its Neck is half a League broad, its Circumference ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred Miles. There be ſome ſalt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, where any man takes as much ſalt as he has occaſion for. The Inhabitants boaſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having been ſubdued.

Their Tongue comes near the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> but they gabble it out faſter. It was their Predeceſſors, known under the name of <hi>Scythians,</hi> who ſent former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Darius,</hi> who would have ſubdued them, a Rat, a Frog, a Bird and five Arrows, for to declare to him, that he would find it a hard matter to retire out of their Countrey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had imprudently engaged himſelf. Yet they could not then draw any great advantage from their Cavalry, wherein now conſiſts their principal ſtrength, by reaſon of the bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Aſſes, which were in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Leſſer Tartars</hi> have in all times made incurſions upon their Neighbours, for which reaſon all their Frontiers is a deſart. After they have made a great number of Slaves, they go to ſell them in the Sea-Ports, from whence
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:153186:186"/>they are commonly tranſported to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Their Country is very populous; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Inhabitants have often there each forty or fifty Children in a year: they go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all to the War: principally the <hi>Nogays,</hi> from the age of ſeven years, that they go out of their <hi>Gantares,</hi> which are Huts or Portative Houſes, they alwaies remain in the field. Theſe Huts are of Ozier, of a round form, two Fathoms in Diameter, they put them upon Wheels, and uſe them in Summer more than in Winter. Few Houſes in <hi>Leſſer Tartary</hi> are built with Stone and Mortar, moſt of them are only of Wood, covered with Planks, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with Poſts fixed in the Earth, and interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Branches of Trees. Robbery is there tolerated, and there needs no more for any ones juſtification upon that account, than to ſay they ſtood in need of what they ſtole. The Inhabitants do not much care for the Sciences, they learn what they know by common Sence; it is ſaid of them, they have eaten their Books and carry them in their Stomacks. They have ſeveral Horſes very ſwift, ſmall, lean, who live commonly on Roots and Leaves of Trees; the greateſt Lords have of them very good, they take ſo much care of their Horſes, that it is become a Proverb amongſt them, <hi>That to loſe ones Horſe is to loſe ones Head.</hi> They make ſometimes up a hundred thouſand Horſe, and go eaſily Marches of four Months without Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; the Bow of their Saddle ſerves them for a Pillow, the Horſe-Cloth which is of Preſſed Wool or of Felt, ſerves them for a Coverlet, their Cloak for a Tent: each Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per carries a Pickax; their Servants ſleep in

When they are Children their Mothers take care to bath them once a day in Water, wherein Salt is diſſolved, to harden their Skin, and render them leſs ſenſible of the cold, when in Winter they are obliged to paſs Rivers by ſwimming. Each <hi>Tartar</hi> has a Whiſtle, a Gamelle, which is a Porrenger of Wood or of Copper, a Whip, a Knife, an Awl, Packthread, Thread, Points and little Cords of Leather, a Marriners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; every ten have a Chaldron and a little Drum.

Thus <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has had Soveraigns of ſix ſeveral Nations, of the <hi>Brittons, Romans, Saxons, Engliſh, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi> Theſe laſt have eſtabliſhed there the Principal Laws, the King who now reigns is <hi>James</hi> the 2. <hi>England</hi> is a greater Kingdom, more fertile and populous than is either <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is the moſt conſiderable of any State in the Ocean: It produces Corn and Fruits in abundance: the beſt Tin in the World is tranſported thence; Wool, Cloaths, Hides and other Commodities both excellent and in great plenty; neither is it wanting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:153186:190"/>Liquors. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſes, Dogs and Cocks are in high eſteem all over the World. No Wolves have been ſeen there ſince the general hunting, which deſtroyed them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all, by the means of permiſſion Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals had of redeeming their Lives with the Heads of thoſe Animals. Gunners and Dogs were for ſometime kept upon Frontiers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder the Wolves' which were hunted out, from returning into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The great reſpect that is paid to Ladys in this Realm, has given occaſion to the ſaying; that <hi>England is the Paradiſe of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Purgatory of Servants, and the Hell of Horſes.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the moſt part are well proportioned, and of a generous Nature. They have had ſo great an Antipathy to the <hi>Scots,</hi> that <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. the ſame who was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before his Eldeſt Brother, by reaſon of the Beauty of his Body, recommended, that after his Death, they ſhould boyl him until they parted his Fleſh and his Bones, that they ſhould bury his Fleſh, and carry his Bones along to the War againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soveraigns of the Ocean, and have made thoſe States and Potentates to repent, who have dared to diſpute their Right to that Title. Their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is compared to the <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> in the ſhell, who has all his Defences collected. The acquiſition of ſome Places by the allyance with <hi>Portugal,</hi> has obliged them to extraordinary expences. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>with all War, and Peace with England.</hi> The general Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is the reformed, the King of <hi>England</hi> is the Head of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church, where of the Principal Members are the Biſhops,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:153186:190"/>who compoſe the Houſe of Lords with the other Peers.

The principal Rivers of <hi>England</hi> are, the <hi>Thames, Severn</hi> and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which do not encreaſe by the Rains, the neighbouring Lands being ſandy. There be reckoned one and fifty Counties called <hi>Shires;</hi> each of thoſe Counties is diſtributed into hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, into Tithings or Tenths. They may be conſidered according to the four Regions of the World; and this diviſion is much the ſame with that the <hi>Romans</hi> made, when they were Maſters of the Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Southern</hi> part of <hi>England</hi> is along the Channel, where be the beſt Harbours of the Kingdom. <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Briſtow</hi> be there conſiderable, the firſt upon the account of its Archbiſhopwrick and of its Primacy; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for its Commerce, Ships arriving there at full Sail. <hi>Rocheſter</hi> is the uſual Station of the Kings Ships, which are called men of War, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, Yachts. <hi>Salisbury</hi> has a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church, wherein are reckoned as many Doors as there be Months, and as many Windows as there be days in the year. <hi>Windſor</hi> is a Royal Caſtle near the <hi>Thames,</hi> where the Ceremonies of the order of the Garter are generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. <hi>Dover</hi> is known for its ſtrong Caſtle, for Peoples embarking there for <hi>Calice, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> and <hi>Oſtend;</hi> for the Neighbourhood of the Downs, under whoſe ſhelter, the Ships that are bound towards the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and towards the <hi>South,</hi> may wait ſafely for Winds, fair for their Voyage. <hi>Haſtings</hi> is a place

                  <p>The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part has this advantage, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>London,</hi> the Capital of all the Realm, one of the Greateſt, Richeſt and moſt Populous Cityes in the World, by the means of its greateſt traffick. Its Scituation is upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> where it receives the nobleſt Ships of the Univerſe; its Bridge is three hundred and thirty Paces in length. The Paſtures and Meads round about would make a moſt pleaſant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Landskip, if the Smoak of Coals which is commonly burnt there, did not raiſe a continual Cloud. <hi>Norwich</hi> is one of the beſt Cities, and moſt populous of all the Kingdom. <hi>Yarmouth</hi> ſees the fiſhing of Herrings performed in its Neighbourhood, where at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is held a fair for that purpoſe. <hi>Cambridge</hi> one of the moſt famous Univerſities in the World. <hi>Harwich</hi> a famous Port.

                  <p>Towards the midſt of the Realm is <hi>Oxford,</hi> with one of the four moſt famous Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein there is thirty three Colledges, that of the Univerſity has a Library full of very curious Manuſcripts; unleſs it be that of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> there be few in the World that have any ſo fine. <hi>Glouceſter</hi> is commonly the appan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

                  <p>THis Kingdom is the ancient <hi>Caledonia,</hi> which was called <hi>Scotland</hi> from the <hi>Scots,</hi> a People who made a ſharp War upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and obliged them to make entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their Incurſions, principally under <hi>Adrian</hi> and under <hi>Severus.</hi> The Name of <hi>Albany</hi> has been ſometimes given to all this Kingdom, whereas it is now peculiar to one of its Countys, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Broad Albiny.</hi> Some <hi>Scotch</hi> Authors, make the Name of <hi>Scotch</hi> come from the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> for the ſhowing their Predeceſſours in the Higher Antiquity. <hi>Scotland</hi> is of a cold Temperature; its Gulphs, Lakes and Mountains hinder its Provinces from being over Fertile. The Inhabitants are of the reformed Religion, Popery having been there aboliſh'd under King <hi>James</hi> the 6th. But the many <hi>Scots</hi> which Sprung up with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, produced there many Troubles, and occaſioned moſt of the diſorders, which in our time we have ſeen in the Kingdoms of <hi>England,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:153186:192"/>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> There be ſtill at this day <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> who call themſelves the Sweet Singers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and are retire into the Mountains and into the Woods, though they be hardly able to ſubſiſt there. The <hi>Southern Scots</hi> live much after the ſame way as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Northern</hi> are wedded to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and not over careful of neatneſs in their Repaſts. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation has for a long while been in eſteem for Valour and Fidelity; the moſt <hi>Chriſtiam</hi> King St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and his Succeſſours the <hi>French</hi> Kings have truſted them with the Guard of their Royal Perſons, and made allyance with <hi>Scotland.</hi> This Kingdom is now the moſt ancient in the World, it is ſaid to have been above two thouſand years hereditary, with a Succeſſion of about a hundred and ten Kings. The Power and Revenues of the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are rendred much more conſiderabbe ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration, and his re-ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Power of raiſing Forces by Sea and Land; of making Peace or War, with the command of the Caſtles, of the Cittadels and Garriſons of the Kingdom. The richneſs of the Countrey conſiſts in Wool, in Cattle, and Salt-Fiſh. Its Land has ſeveral Mines of Lead, Iron, Sulphur, Azure, and Coal. Its principal Rivers have a prodigious Quantity of Salmon.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Scotland</hi> is divided into two great parts by the River of <hi>Tay,</hi> the one <hi>Northern,</hi> the other <hi>Southern. Northern Scotland,</hi> contained under the name of High-lands, is that where the <hi>Romans</hi> could not carry their Armies, and where in our times the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliamentaries had not all the Succeſs they had promiſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:153186:193"/>It was the abode of the ancient <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe Kings had their reſidence at <hi>Dunſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fag.</hi> The Robberies of the Inhabitants have been there formerly ſo frequent, principally in the Province of <hi>Albania,</hi> that if by the Law any one of the Province had committed a Robbery, he amongſt them whom a man could ſeize of, was obliged to repair the loſs, or to loſe his Life. <hi>Aberdeen</hi> is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable City of this Country, by reaſon of its Univerſity, and of its Pearls which are found in its little River, and of the Salmons that are taken in its Neighbourhood, where three hundred are ſaid to be ſometimes taken at one Caſt of the Net.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Southern</hi> part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is called Lower, is a better Country than the upper. There is to be ſeen <hi>Edenborough,</hi> the Capital of the Kingdom, the abode of the late Kings. St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Glaſcow</hi> have the Title of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks. St. <hi>Andrew</hi> has alſo a famous Univerſity, I ſay, famous for ſuch a Kingdom as that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>Glaſcow</hi> paſſes for a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. <hi>Abernethi</hi> was the abode of the King of the <hi>Picts. Duns</hi> upon the Marches of <hi>England,</hi> is the place of Birth of the ſubtil Doctor <hi>Scotus.

It is defended with good Walls, whereas moſt of the other Cities of the Kingdom have none at all. The Coronation of the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> is performed at <hi>Scone,</hi> near St. <hi>Johns-Town.</hi> There was in this Abby a Marble Chair, from which the Royalty of <hi>Scotland</hi> was eſteemed inſeparable; but the King of <hi>England, Edward</hi> the 4th having transferred it to <hi>London,</hi> it looks
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:153186:193"/>as if King <hi>James</hi> the 6th. was as it were forced to go thither. That Chair had been before in the Country of <hi>Argyle. Dunbar</hi> is an old Caſtle, the Fortifications whereof have been deſtroyed The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliamentaries won a Battail there in the year 1650. <hi>Dunbarton</hi> is a Fortreſs upon a Rock near a Lake, where the Fiſh are ſaid to have no bones. The Iſles of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Baſs</hi> have Caſtles ſituated upon inacceſſible Rocks. The Garriſon of that of <hi>Baſs</hi> receives great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencyes from the Geeſe, Sea Coots or Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hens, which go there to make their Neſts; theſe Fowls furniſh abundance of Wood for Fewel.</p>
                  <p>Among the Iſlands which depend on <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The <hi>Hebrides</hi> are on the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> of that Kingdom. The Inhabitants of the <hi>Orcades</hi> keep carefully the Cup of St. <hi>Magnus,</hi> whom they name their Apoſtle. With this Cup they try their Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, and hope for abundance of good from 'em, when thoſe Prelates empty it quite. They are of ſo good a complexion, that they never take Phyſick. Towards the <hi>North</hi> of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> there be the Iſles of <hi>Scetland,</hi> which we have ſaid to depend on the Crown of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Inſularies there are ſo healthful and ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, that they make no ſcruple of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they are a hundred years old: Nay they go a fiſhing at the age of a hundred and thirty and a hundred and forty. <hi>Zeal,</hi> one of theſe Iſlands, ſuffers no Forreign Animals: they dye as ſoon as they come there.</p>

                     <hi>Ireland</hi> is divided according to the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Regions of the World, into four parts; <hi>Leinſter, Ulſter, Cannaught</hi> and <hi>Munſter;</hi> formerly <hi>Meeth</hi> was reckoned for a fifth, but is now accounted a Member of <hi>Leinſter.</hi> There is ſtill another Diviſion which divides all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into two parts, whereof the one is the Province of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the other the Country of the true <hi>Iriſh,</hi> though the whole Country has been ſubdued, and there is almoſt every where <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Collonies.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:153186:196"/>Rendezvouz. <hi>Palermo</hi> is the Capital of the Iſland, formerly the abode of the Kings, and the uſual Reſidence of the Vice-Roy for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who does Homage to the <hi>Pope</hi> for his Kingdom. <hi>Auguſta</hi> is conſiderable for its Scituation and for its Port; all defended by three Fortreſſes. <hi>Syragouſa,</hi> or rather <hi>Saracouſa,</hi> formerly <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> one of the beſt Cities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, is noted in Hiſtory for its Wars, for its Tyrants, for its Fountain <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> for the brave reſiſtance which it made againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Marcellus,</hi> by the help of the <hi>Machines,</hi> which the famous <hi>Archimedes</hi> had raiſed there for the defence of his Countrey: It had before ſhewed its Puiſſance againſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, at the Solicitation of the <hi>Segeſtains,</hi> had beſieged it. The Tyranny of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and the invention of the Brazen Bull by <hi>Perillus</hi> has made <hi>Gergenti</hi> renowned. <hi>Noto</hi> has in its Neighbourhood a River, where there are ſaid to have been tame Fiſh, which eat out of Mens Hands. <hi>Comarana</hi> is near that ancient Moor or Lake, the draining whereof (contrary to the advice of the Oracle) brought upon its Inhabitants a Peſtilence, and the Invaſion of their Enemies. <hi>Trapano</hi> accompanyed with its Port, was noted by the Ancients for the Death of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> the Father of <hi>Aeneas;</hi> it is known by the Moderns for its Salt-Pits, for the fiſhing of <hi>Corail</hi> and of tunny-fiſhies, which is performed there. <hi>Mont-real</hi> an Archbiſhops See, has a fine Cathedral Church built by the <hi>Normans. Melazzo</hi> ſtill preſerves the firſt Monaſtery of the Fathers <hi>Minims,</hi> whom the <hi>Popiſh Saint Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Paula</hi> cauſed to be built. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did particularly make uſe of this place for the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:153186:196"/>Reduction of <hi>Meſſina.</hi> Near <hi>Melazzo</hi> was <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> defeated by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> On the <hi>North,</hi> or rather on the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> are the Iſlands of <hi>Lapari,</hi> renowned for the Fable of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> for the firſt Naval Victory of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſome Mountains which by their Fires and Flames gave Means to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to foretel Tempeſts. Towards the <hi>Weſt</hi> are the ancient <hi>Aegades,</hi> where <hi>Catullus</hi> defeated the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at Sea, during the firſt <hi>Punique</hi> War.</p>

                     <hi>Sardinia</hi> as well as <hi>Sicily</hi> belongs to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it lies in the ſame Sea, which is the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but more towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Its Capital City is <hi>Gallari,</hi> the Reſidence of a Vice-Roy and an Archbiſhops See, and there is gathered that <hi>Sardonique</hi> Herb, which makes People dye laughing, becauſe that it contracts the Nerves and Muſcles, particularly thoſe of the Mouth. When the <hi>Ionians</hi> were ſubdued by the <hi>Perſians, Bias</hi> one of the ſeven Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> propoſed to them the Inhabiting of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> becauſe of the Convenience of its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Corſica</hi> is on the <hi>South</hi> of the Seigneury of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Miſtreſs of it. An <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb runs, that a <hi>Corſican</hi> is not to be truſted alive or dead. The <hi>Corſicans,</hi> as their Enemies ſay, have ſo great an inclination to thievery, that if they do not ſteal in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, they willingly riſe out of their Tombs to ſteal after their death; they alſo ſay that their ancient Pyracies did occaſion the name of <hi>Corſaires</hi> to Pyrates and Sea-Robbers. In this Iſland is found the Stone <hi>Catochite,</hi> which ſticks to Peoples hands like glue, when they touch it.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:153186:197"/>The City of <hi>Baſtia</hi> is the abode of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> call Vice-Roy. The Ancients reckoned in this Iſland above thirty good Cities, which have been for the moſt part ruined. <hi>Boniface</hi> is now the moſt commodious Haven with a Fortreſs, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one of the beſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon of its advantageous Situation in the <hi>Peninſula.</hi>

                     <hi>CAndia</hi> formerly <hi>Crete,</hi> is one of the greateſt Iſlands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, with the Title of Kingdom, at the entrance of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago,</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Europe,</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> Upon the conſideration of ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous a Situation, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was perſwaded that it might be made the Seat of the univerſal Empire. It is above two hundred Miles in length, about forty five or fifty in breadth: It has had full a hundred Cities, tho' it has now more than four, which be any thing eminent. It was renowned in antiquity for its excellent Archers, for the Ship called the Bull, which ſerved to carry away the Beautiful <hi>Europa,</hi> for the Amours of <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> for the Cruelty of the <hi>Minotaur,</hi> for the Birth, Abode and Funeral of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> for the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Minos,</hi> for the Labyrinth, whereof the invention is attributed to <hi>Daedalus.</hi> Its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Inhabitants ſaid, that moſt of the Gods were born in their Countrey: But little Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be giv'n to people who have always paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for great Lyars. Except the <hi>Sfaciotes,</hi> who paſs
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:153186:197"/>for Bravos, the <hi>Candiots</hi> have the reputation of flying from Toyl, of truſtiing in the goodneſs of their Soyl, which furniſhes them with Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Wine, ſeveral good Fruits and other Commodities. Mount <hi>Ida</hi> is its higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from its peak or top both Seas may eaſily be ſeen. Several Plains and Valleys are fertile in <hi>Candy;</hi> but few are watred otherwiſe than with Torrents. The <hi>Cretes</hi> were ſo ſuccesful in Navigation, that they rendred themſelves Maſters of the Seas under <hi>Minos</hi> one of their Kings. This Prince made Laws for them, and that they might be the better eſtabliſhed, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had concerted them, during the ſpace of nine years, with <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Afterwards this Iſland was governed by a Republick, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the time of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Emperours of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> were alſo Maſters of it; after which it was given to <hi>Boniface,</hi> Prince of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> who ſold it to the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the year 1194. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing this Iſland in the midſt of their Dominions, thought it was for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to diſlodge the <hi>Venetians</hi> from thence; which they accordingly did in the year 1669. after a War of four and twenty years.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland is divided into four Territories, which bear the Names of ſo many principal Cities. <hi>Candia</hi> which is Capital thereof, and the Metropolitan, <hi>Canea, Rettimo</hi> and <hi>Sittia.</hi> The principal Fortreſſes of the Iſland are upon the Coaſt, either in Iſlands or <hi>Peninſula's,</hi> the <hi>Grabuſes, Suda</hi> and <hi>Spinalonga</hi> which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the <hi>Venetians</hi> by the laſt peace between the <hi>Republick</hi> and the <hi>Port.</hi>
